&tex=Although people had settled in China by at least 4500 B.C, the first Chinese state began in around 1500 B.C. with the start of the Shang dynasty.
Many thousands of ornate bronze vessels have been found from this time. These were used to make offerings to ancestors – as it was believed the ancestors could intercede with the gods for their family.  The vast number of bronzes found shows the existence of a well organized bronze industry.  This high level of organization was later applied to the iron industry and public building works.  
This was a time of almost constant warfare. Defensive walls were built around the boundaries of each state. Some of these walls would later be joined to create the Great Wall.  Trade was encouraged to fund military campaigns and coins were cast by many different states and cities.  
In 221 B.C. the country was united into a single empire under Qin Shi Huangdi.  The Chinese Empire would survive for over two thousand years.
