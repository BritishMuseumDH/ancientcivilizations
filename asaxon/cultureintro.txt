&tex=In AD 410 the crisis facing the Roman Empire forced the Romans to pull their support and soldiers out of Britain.  Even before AD 410, groups of Saxon raiders had attacked the east coast of Britain, but when the Romans left more Saxons were invited to defend England from other raids. During the fifth century, these people and others from northern Europe, the Angles and Jutes, settled in Britain
The new settlers brought their pagan beliefs with them. Their burial practices included placing various objects in the grave that would be of use to a person in the afterlife. For high status people, these grave goods could be very rich, including objects made of gold and silver. The most impressive high status burial of the Anglo-Saxon period is the ship burial at Sutton Hoo.
The Anglo-Saxons used the runic script for writing, which was used in many parts of northern Europe. One of the most important objects from Anglo-Saxon Britain is the Frank’s Casket, which is inscribed with runes in two languages: Old English and Latin.
