&tex=By A.D.1500 the leading group of peoples in central Mexico were the Aztec.  The Aztecs founded the city of Tenochtiitlan in 1325.  At the beginning of the sixteenth century it was one of the largest cities in the world.  Over two centuries the Aztecs gradually expanded their power to include most of central and southern Mexico.  
The Aztecs were well known for their ferocity and warfare was extremely important for the Aztec people.  It helped them to control vast trade routes and it was important for their religion as they believed that human blood was needed by the gods to keep the world alive.  The enemy captured during battle would be brought back to the Great Temple or local shrines and sacrificed to the Aztec gods, such as Xipe Totec, the spirit of new growth.
In A.D. 1519 Hernán Cortés landed on the Gulf coast of Mexico.  Within two years the Spanish, with their local allies, had defeated the Aztecs and taken control of the city of Tenochtitlan.  The buildings in the centre of the city, including the fifty metre high Great Temple, were destroyed and the area was settled by Spanish colonists.  However, there are still a few million people in Mexico who are descendents of the Aztecs and still speak the Aztec language Nahuatl.
