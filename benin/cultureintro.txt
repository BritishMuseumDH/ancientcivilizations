&tex=Benin is located in modern Nigeria. Its history goes back to a least the thirteenth century. It was ruled by a king called the Oba and became particularly powerful during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, when its boundaries were expanded by several warrior kings. It was at this stage that a new palace was constructed for the Oba, the ruins of which can still be seen today.
At the end of the fifteenth century Benin came into contact with Europeans, in particular the Portuguese, who were interested in the trade of slaves and other goods and also spreading Christianity. In return for the African goods they wanted, the Portuguese gave brass and copper rings, amongst other items. This brass provided the material basis for the flourishing of brass casting in Benin in the sixteenth century. Brass casting was used to make brass plaques which decorated the palace of the king, as well as other royal objects. 
European trade contact continued, but by the mid-nineteenth century Benin was no longer the focus of the area’s trade with Europeans. A trade disagreement with Britain led to a British military expedition against Benin where much of the palace and town were destroyed and many works of art were confiscated. The king was exiled but his son was restored as ruler, although Benin was now part of a British colony.
Benin still has an Oba today.  He lives in a palace built over part of the old palace and many of the traditions and religious beliefs are maintained.  Brass casting continues today in Benin but now the products are available to tourists as well as the king.
