tex=The Aztecs thought that every part of the world was sacred. Images of the gods were made to represent the <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/s/sacred.html','glos')">sacred</a></u></font> nature of everything in the sky, on the earth and all things in between. The Aztecs also believed that the Great Temple was at the centre of their universe. Its pyramid structure mirrored the shape of the sacred mountains and was also an image of the way the Aztecs saw the universe, which they divided into levels. Above the temple were the thirteen levels of heaven, with the topmost being where the creator god, Ometeotl lived. Underneath the temple were the nine levels of the underworld, through which the souls of the dead passed on their way to the deepest level.
