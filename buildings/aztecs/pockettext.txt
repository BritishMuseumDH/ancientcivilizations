text_1=This picture shows the pyramid shaped Great Temple in a walled <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/sacred.html','glos')">sacred</a></u></font> area surrounded by other <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/shrine.html','glos')">shrines</a></u></font> and <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/a/administrative.html','glos')">administrative</a></u></font> buildings. The first temple built on this site dates to AD 1325 but the temple was enlarged on six occasions to <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/commemorate.html','glos')">commemorate</a></u></font> different rulers. Each time a ruler enlarged the temple the earlier structure was simply encased by the new structure. The pyramid structure of the temple is thought by experts to recreate the sacred hill of Coatepec where the Aztec god, Huitzilopochtli, was born. Also, for the Aztecs, the pyramid shape was like a man-made mountain, mirroring the sacred mountains that surrounded their city.
&text_2=The temple was in several stories to form a stepped pyramid. The surface was covered with stucco, which is a type of plaster, and then painted. It was further decorated by large sculptures that included sculptures of serpent heads. Built into the walls of the temple were over one hundred sacrificial deposits or <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/o/offering.html','glos')">offerings</a></u></font> contained in stone boxes. The offerings included objects that came from the natural world: the sky, earth and water, as the Aztecs believed that every part of their world was sacred. Most of these offerings were linked to the god Tlaloc. At the base of the pyramid, before the flight of steps that led to the top of the temple, was a stone that showed the goddess Coyolxauhqui, who was the sister of Huitzilopochtli, and had been killed by him at his birth and flung down a mountain.
&text_3=The faces of the pyramid had been built at a steep angle and it has been suggested that this was to ensure the bodies of sacrificed people rolled to the bottom of the structure once their hearts had been removed at the top. There were two parallel staircases up one side of the temple leading to the temple platform and the two shrines of Tlaloc and Huitzilopochtli.
&text_4=In front of the two shrines was a green stone where the sacrificial victims would have their hearts removed. The shrines were towards the back of the platform when viewed from the top of the stairs and were roofed with thatch. The shrine of Tlaloc was painted white and blue and that of Huitzilopochtli was decorated with carved skulls painted white on a red background. In each of the shrines were statues of the gods (called idols). These statues have not survived but from descriptions written by the Spanish conquerors we can get an idea about what they looked like.
&text_5=From the writings of the Spanish conquerors, we think that some of them saw inside one of the shrines on top of the Great Temple. It seems that they went into the shrine of Huitzilopochtli, the supreme Aztec god. The shrine was very dark, creating an atmosphere of mystery and making a detailed description of what was inside rather difficult. However, they describe two <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/a/altar.html','glos')">altars</a></u></font>, one to Huitzilopochtli, the other to the god Tezcatlipoca. The eyes of the idols were shining stones. Huitzilopochtli carried a golden bow and arrows and wore gold and silver objects around his neck.
<font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/b/brazier.html','glos')">Braziers</a></u></font> stood in front of the idols and held the hearts of sacrificial victims. There was a strong smell and the beating of a drum could be heard. The priests that attended these shrines were dressed in black and had hair that was uncombed and knotted. As well as using the hearts of sacrificial victims, the priests often made offerings of their own blood, which they took from their earlobes.
