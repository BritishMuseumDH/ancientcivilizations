        <p>From the writings of the Spanish conquerors, we think that some of 
          them saw inside one of the shrines on top of the Great Temple. It seems 
          that they went into the shrine of Huitzilopochtli, the supreme Aztec 
          god. The shrine was very dark, creating an atmosphere of mystery and 
          making a detailed description of what was inside rather difficult. However, 
          they describe two altars, one to Huitzilopochtli, the other to the god 
          Tezcatlipoca. The eyes of the idols were shining stones. Huitzilopochtli 
          carried a golden bow and arrows and wore gold and silver objects around 
          his neck. Braziers stood in front of the idols and held the hearts of 
          sacrificial victims. There was a strong smell and the beating of a drum 
          could be heard. The priests that attended these shrines were dressed 
          in black and had hair that was uncombed and knotted. As well as using 
          the hearts of sacrificial victims, the priests often made offerings 
          of their own blood, which they took from their earlobes.</p>
