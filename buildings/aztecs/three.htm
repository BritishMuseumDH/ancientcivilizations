        <p>The temple was in several stories to form a stepped pyramid. The surface 
          was covered with stucco, which is a type of plaster, and then painted. 
          It was further decorated by large sculptures that included sculptures 
          of serpent heads. Built into the walls of the temple were over one hundred 
          sacrificial deposits or offerings contained in stone boxes. The offerings 
          included objects that came from the natural world: the sky, earth and 
          water, as the Aztecs believed that every part of their world was sacred. 
          Most of these offerings were linked to the god Tlaloc. At the base of 
          the pyramid, before the flight of steps that led to the top of the temple, 
          was a stone that showed the goddess Coyolxauhqui, who was the sister 
          of Huitzilopochtli, and had been killed by him at his birth and flung 
          down a mountain.</p>
