&object_1=<font face="Arial" size="14"><b>A Portuguese man</b><BR><BR>The Portuguese were extremely important in the early history of Benin.  They explored the west coast of Africa and reached Benin sometime between 1472 and 1486.  Contact with the Portuguese was very important for the Oba.  He used their soldiers to support him in his wars and traded coral beads, cloth and <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/m/manilla.html','glos')"><u>manillas</u></a></font> with them.  The brass manillas  were melted down to make brass objects used by the king. <BR><BR>The people of Benin provided the Portuguese with pepper, cloth, ivory and slaves.  The Portuguese were always connected to the wealth and power they brought to the Oba and people of Benin because of their trade.  In showing these people in his palace decorations, the Oba reminded the people of this wealth and power.</font>

&object_2=<font face="Arial" size="14"><b>Shields</b><BR><BR>Each of the central figures is holding a shield used in warfare.  The shield is called an asa.  There are many plaques from the palace that show the Oba and his chiefs wearing battle dress and carrying weapons ready for war.  The Oba needed to show that he deserved to be king and being a good leader in times of war proved this.  Some of the plaques that exist relate to famous battles won by different Obas.</font>

&object_3=<font face="Arial" size="14"><b>Pages</b><BR><BR>The two slightly smaller figures are probably <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/p/pages.html','glos')"><u>pages</u></a></font>. They were naked until the Oba granted them clothes. This would be a sign of their rise in standing and social <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/status.html','glos')"><u>status</u></a></font>. The lesser height of the pages compared to the warriors may also indicate their lower status.</font>

&object_4=<font face="Arial" size="14"><b>Necklace of Leopard's teeth</b><BR><BR>The leopard was the animal most closely connected to the Oba of Benin.  The leopard was seen as the king of the forest by the people of Benin and therefore was connected to the Oba, the king of their land.  A necklace of leopard's teeth gave the wearer protection in battle.</font>

&object_5=<font face="Arial" size="14"><b>Warriors</b><BR><BR>The two larger central figures are probably warriors bearing shields.</font>

&object_6=<font face="Arial" size="14"><b>Leopards</b><BR><BR>The leopard was the animal most closely connected to the Oba of Benin.  The leopard was seen as the king of the forest by the people of Benin and therefore was connected to the Oba, the king of their land.<BR><BR>Leopards were captured for sacrifice and also tamed for the king. When he paraded through Benin with leopards by his side, it showed that he had power over the creatures of the forest.</font>

&object_7=<font face="Arial" size="14"><b>River leaves</b><BR><BR>This <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/q/quatrefoil.html','glos')"><u>quatrefoil</u></a></font> design is connected to river leaves.  River leaves were used in religious ceremonies connected to Olokun, the god of the waters.  This design was particularly important for the Obas in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, since during this period the sea was connected with their great wealth and power.  The Portuguese traders who came over the sea provided support for the Oba's army and traded objects connected with power, such as cowrie shells from the east coast of Africa, brass and corals.</font>

&object_8=<font face="Arial" size="14"><b>The palace spire</b><BR><BR>Every roof in the palace had a spire with a bird perched on top. The spires for the palace gate were also decorated with snakes running down the length of the turrets. The snake was connected to the god Osun by the people of Benin.<BR><BR>Osun was one of the gods of the forest and in particular was connected to the sacred power of the herbs and plants found in the forest.  Snakes were the warriors of the Osun.<BR><BR>The python was also a symbol and messenger of Olokun, the god of water. By displaying a snake on his palace the Oba was showing his connection to the gods Osun and Olokun.<BR><BR>The bird was possibly an image of the bird of prophecy.  This bird wrongly prophesied Oba Esigie's defeat by the Igala people when in fact he was successful. The bird in Benin images reminds the people of the Oba's strength in war.

&object_9=<font face="Arial" size="14"><b>A snake</b><BR><BR>The snake was connected to the god Osun by the people of Benin.  Osun was one of the gods of nature and in particular was connected to the sacred power of the herbs and plants found in the forest.  Snakes were the warriors of the Osun.<BR><BR>The python was also a symbol and messenger of Olokun, the god of water. It was said that pythons were sent by Olokun to punish wrongdoing. By displaying a snake on his palace the Oba was showing his connection to the gods Osun and Olokun. </font>

&object_10=<font face="Arial" size="14"><b>The palace</b><BR><BR>The palace was the most important symbol of wealth and power for the Oba.  There were two main areas in the city of Benin, the Oba's residence and market and the rest of the town. <BR><BR>Although the city was largely destroyed in 1897 we know where the original palace was and the modern palace now stands in the same place.  The original palace was the centre of the Benin world.  Its decoration reminded the inhabitants of Benin about the Oba's power in war, his connection to the gods and his ancestors, and also his wealth and power that came from his contacts with local regions and Europe.</font>
