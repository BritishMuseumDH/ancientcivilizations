intro=The King of Benin ruled over one of the most important kingdoms in Africa.  Between about 1300 and 1897 the Oba or King lived in a palace in the centre of the city of Benin.  The palace was the most important building in the kingdom; it was the Oba's residence and the focus of local rule and power.  Much of the city was destroyed and the palace was looted by the British in 1897 after a dispute over trading rights.  In 1914 the people of Benin started the reconstruction of the palace that stands on the site of the original palace today.<br><br>The palace was built out of wood and decorated to demonstrate the importance and status of the king. Sculptures carved in wood, ivory and brass decorated the walls of the palace.  Although the original building no longer exists the works of art have survived.  One of these plaques even provides an important clue as to what the palace might have looked like with the plaques in place.
