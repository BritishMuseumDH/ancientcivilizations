tex=The festival of the Panathenaia was celebrated every year, with a greater celebration every four years.  The festival started on the traditional date of Athena’s birth, the 28th Hekatombaion (July/August) and lasted for four days.  On the first day of the four yearly festival, a great procession wound its way through Athens to the top of the acropolis and presented the sacred robe to Athena at her altar.  The rest of the festival was celebrated with athletic and musical contests, readings from Homer and a torch race on the night of the 27/28 Hekatombaion.
