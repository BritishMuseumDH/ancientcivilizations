&tex=In ancient Greece many towns and cities were built around hills and outcrops of rock.  These places were easily defended due to their height and walls built on top made them even more difficult to attack.  The people could retreat to the top of the hill or rock if they were attacked by raiders or invaders.  This part of the city or town was called the acropolis which means the highest part of the city.
Over time the most important buildings in each city would be built on the acropolis.  Here palaces, temples and treasuries could be defended.  Also their position in the city, where they could be seen on the top of the acropolis, demonstrated how important these buildings were.
