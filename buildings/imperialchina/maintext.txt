&tex=The Great Wall of China is one of the largest construction projects ever carried out.  It is often incorrectly thought to be the only man-made object visible from the moon. Nevertheless, at around 4,500 miles in length, it is certainly a monumental structure.
The first Great Wall was built under the Qin dynasty (221 B.C. – 207 B.C.) The emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi, ordered that the existing defensive walls of the old warring states should be joined together.  In the centuries after that, the Wall was rebuilt and added to many times.
It provided an excellent defence against the nomads who lived to the north of China. For the early Chinese, the Wall also marked the limits of the civilized world. Qin Shi Huangdi believed China was the most civilized nation in the world. The Wall separated China from the nomadic peoples of the North and West.
