&tex=One of the most famous buildings in the world, the Taj Mahal was built by Emperor Shah Jahan in loving memory of his favourite wife Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal has become a symbol of enduring love and is one of the biggest tourist attractions in modern India.
It took 20,000 labourers twenty-two years to complete Shah Jahan’s vision. Built in white marble, the Taj Mahal was decorated with semi-precious gems from all over the world. The main tomb is flanked by a mosque and a guest house, and is set in a traditional Islamic, formal garden called a charbagh, and is walled in with red sandstone. 
It was Shah Jahan’s passion for architecture that saw the Mughal empire add some of its most beautiful and impressive buildings to its heritage. The Taj Mahal is the pinnacle of Shah Jahan’s ambition, a visual summary of the wealth and splendour of the Mughal Empire.
