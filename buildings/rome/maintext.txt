&tex=For many people in the ancient world a monumental building was a place of mystery.   In most cases only the priests or important people were allowed to enter these buildings. However, there was one type of building in the ancient world that was built for everybody, the amphitheatre.   The amphitheatre was open to all, even slaves.
Roman holidays were usually accompanied by games, chariot races and plays.  Until the reign of Vespasian, the emperor of Rome from AD 69 to AD 79, these events were held in temporary buildings.  Vespasian wanted the people of Rome to admire and support his reign.  He built a permanent amphitheatre where they could enjoy the games and show their support for him.  The amphitheatre was known as the Flavian amphitheatre or the Colosseum.
