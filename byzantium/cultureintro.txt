&tex=The city of Byzantium (modern Istanbul) started out as a Greek city in the seventh century BC, but rose to prominence when it was rebuilt by the Roman emperor Constantine the Great in AD 324-30 to be his capital of the Roman Empire. It was then named Constantinople. When the Roman Empire was split into a western and eastern empire under Emperor Theodosius, Constantinople became increasingly important. When Rome itself fell to invaders called the Ostrogoths in 476, Constantinople was left as the capital of the remaining Roman world in the east, which became known as the Byzantine Empire.  
Constantine had many new buildings constructed in Constantinople (Byzantium). He had an oval forum and a senate built and enlarged the Hippodrome, which was where chariot racing took place. He also built the Great Palace. However, perhaps the most famous building in Constantinople was built by Emperor Justinian in AD 532. It was called Hagia Sophia and for 1000 years was the largest church in the world.
During the reign of Justinian the Byzantine Empire was at its largest. This period also saw a golden age in art, which tended to focus on religious subjects, including the production of religious icons. Great works of art were again produced during a revival of the empire in the ninth to twelfth centuries AD. 
From 1261 onwards, the Byzantine Empire was in decline and by the end of the fourteenth century it was being threatened by the Ottoman (Turkish) empire. Constantinople finally fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.
