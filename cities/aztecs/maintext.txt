&tex=Tenochtitlan was the capital city of the Aztec empire, which stretched across a large part of what is now Mexico. It was a huge city with a population of around 200,000, which made it bigger than most cities in Europe at the time and certainly the biggest city in the American continents. The city was discovered by Spanish soldiers, led by a man named Cortés, who were in search of land and riches such as gold in the newly discovered lands of the Americas. When they saw the city, they were amazed by its size and splendour.
