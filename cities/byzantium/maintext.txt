&tex=Byzantium (modern Istanbul) had begun life as a Greek settlement but became one of the most important cities in Europe after it was made the capital of the Roman world. From the time of Emperor Constantine the Great, it had been the main city of the eastern Roman Empire, becoming increasingly important. However, when Rome fell to invading barbarians in AD 476, Constantinople was left as the capital of the remaining Roman Empire, which became known as the Byzantine Empire.

Under Constantine, the city was given many new building, as was appropriate for a place that was to be ‘the new Rome’. Later emperors also added impressive buildings, including perhaps the most famous landmark, the church of Hagia Sophia. This was constructed by Justinian who as emperor, regained control of many of the territories that had formed the western Roman Empire. It is during this time, with Constantinople the capital of a large empire, that we shall explore the city.
