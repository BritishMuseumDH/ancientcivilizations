In southern Africa there is a site which has amazed and confused historians and archaeologists for over 130 years. Great Zimbabwe covers an area of 700 <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/h/hectares.html','glos')">hectares</a></u></font> and boasts the most impressive drystone wall buildings in southern Africa.   Many people have investigated the site, since it was brought to the world's attention in 1871 by a German geologist called Carl Mauch.  However, since the site was severely damaged by Europeans at the end of the nineteenth century, it is not possible to carry out regular archaeological surveys and excavations at the site.
