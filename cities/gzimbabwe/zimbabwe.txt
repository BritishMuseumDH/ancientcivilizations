&intro1=Great Zimbabwe is an extraordinary site but one of the most misunderstood on the African continent.  There are a few early writings about the site by explorers and priests of the sixteenth century and local oral histories, but by the nineteenth century most of the knowledge of who had built Great Zimbabwe and why had been lost.  

&intro2=The lack of evidence has led to a lot of different views or <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/i/interpretation.html','glos')"><u>interpretations</u></a></font> about the site.  Nineteenth century historians and archaeologists did not believe that the local people could have built anything as large as Great Zimbabwe; however, excavations between 1905 and 1930 confirmed that the site had been built by ancestors of a local people, the Shona.  

&intro3=Although most experts agree that the site was a town or city there are different interpretations about what the different buildings were used for and how big the city might have been.  Explore Great Zimbabwe with two archaeologists who have different ways of thinking, which influence how they understand the site.

&instruction=Click on an area of the site and then each of the archaeologists to find out more about the site.

&hillbuildings=<b>Hill buildings</b><br><br>The centre of Great Zimbabwe was focussed on three main areas, the hill buildings with an open court or <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/d/dare.html','glos')"><u><i>dare</i></u></a></font> below, the <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/enclosure.html','glos')"><u>enclosures</u></a></font> to the south of this open court, and the surrounding area of the town.  The hill buildings consist of a number of walls that run between large boulders and outcrops of rock.  Within the walls lots of archaeological remains have survived and show that at one time there were plaster and timber structures here.

&hillbuildingsA=The walls on the hill building are not palace walls or walls for houses.  They are barriers to stop people looking in to an important or powerful place.  I believe that the western end of these buildings was where the king lived and received visitors to his kingdom.

&hillbuildingsB=I am convinced that the rulers of Great Zimbabwe showed their power by <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/enclosing.html','glos')"><u>enclosing</u></a></font> powerful or religious places and the people within them, keeping them out of view to the normal people who lived there.  At first the king probably lived in this area, but as time passed I think that this area was used only for religious purposes and the king moved down the hill to the Great Enclosure.

&dare=<b><i>Dare</i></b><br><br>The centre of Great Zimbabwe was focussed on three main areas, the hill buildings with an open court or <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/d/dare.html','glos')"><u><i>dare</i></u></a></font> below, the <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/enclosure.html','glos')"><u>enclosures</u></a></font> to the south of this open court, and the surrounding area of the town.  The <i>dare</i> forms an open area between the hill buildings and the enclosures to the south.

&dareA=I think that the size of this <i>dare</i> is very important.  It is bigger than all of the other <i>dare</i>s found in this region.  It shows the importance of Great Zimbabwe as a centre or capital of the region.  It provides a central space for people to gather from the other settlements in the region.

&dareB=The <i>dare</i> provides a very good space to meet for the people who lived at Great Zimbabwe.  Many settlements in this region have these open spaces.  The size of the <i>dare</i> just confirms that this was a large settlement which was home to many thousands of people.

&greatenclosure=<b>The Great Enclosure</b><br><br>To the south of the open court (<font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/d/dare.html','glos')"><u><i>dare</i></u></a></font>) lie the <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/enclosure.html','glos')"><u>enclosures</u></a></font> massive walled areas carefully constructed from local <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/g/granite.html','glos')"><u>granite</u></a></font>.  Some areas of the wall show the great skill used in building.  The Great Enclosure provides the best example of the importance of these enclosures, although it is now very damaged.  It has been estimated that there are 900 000 blocks of granite used in the outer wall alone.  Many of the enclosures have not been excavated fully.

&greatenclosureA=In many of the enclosures to the south of the <i>dare</i> (open court) there are slots formed in the walls.  These slots are female symbols and show that these areas housed the royal wives.  I cannot see any other explanation for the walls and buildings.  The Great Enclosure itself was not used as housing for the royal wives, but as a place where important young women, and possibly young men, could come from surrounding regions to be instructed about their future adult and married lives.  This would mark their progression from childhood into adult life. 

&greatenclosureB=All of the enclosures in this area must have once been the walls that surrounded the housing of the rulers of Great Zimbabwe.  In this case the Great Enclosure must be the residence of the king, who previously lived in the Hill Buildings.  The massive walls, showing the importance of the ruler, and the link to the royal wives in the other enclosures makes this the most sensible interpretation of their use.

&enclosure12=<b>Enclosure 12</b><br><br>To the south of the open court lie the <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/enclosure.html','glos')"><u>enclosures</u></a></font>  ; massive walled areas carefully constructed from local granite. An excavation in Enclosure 12 in 1902 unearthed large amounts of <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/i/imported.html','glos')"><u>imported</u></a></font> luxury goods.  
These included pottery vessels, glass beads, and objects of iron, copper and bronze.

&enclosure12A=I believe that slots found in the walls in these enclosures are female symbols and that these enclosures surrounded the houses of the royal wives.  Enclosure 12, with its wealthy possessions must have been the enclosure of the King's first wife.  The Shona people have a tradition that the first wife guards her husband's possessions which would explain the importance of the finds in Enclosure 12. 

&enclosure12B=The wealthy finds from this enclosure suggest that it was the royal treasury of Great Zimbabwe.  Where else would great treasure and luxury imported goods be kept?

&outerAreas=<b>Outer areas</b><br><br>The ordinary people of Great Zimbabwe lived in the area surrounding the hill, <i>dare</i> and the <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/enclosure.html','glos')"><u>enclosures</u></a></font>.  Only one excavation has been carried out and partly published, so little is known about the living areas for most of Great Zimbabwe's population.

&outerAreasA=There is no doubt that the ordinary people of Great Zimbabwe lived in the area surrounding the centre of the town.  From the possible size of the settlement I think that around 30,000 people lived at Great Zimbabwe.

&outerAreasB=The little archaeological work that has been carried out around the centre of the site confirms that the ordinary people lived in this outer area.
