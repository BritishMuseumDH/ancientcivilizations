With the accession of Liu Bang, first emperor of the Han dynasty, in 206 B.C. their hopes were dashed. Liu Bang had to prove quickly that the Chinese Empire had permanence, and the Han were its rightful rulers.  The Han dynasty did as much as possible to prove that it held a mandate to rule.  The first Han emperor chose Chang'an as their capital. It is located nearby the old Qin capital, thus emphasising the continuity of the Empire. The planning of Chang'an itself shows how important it was to be in tune with all the forces of the cosmos. This also reinforced the Han dynasty’s right to rule.
