tex=Today, the Inca capital, Cuzco, still contains the remains of many Inca buildings but also has many Spanish buildings, some of which were built upon Inca foundations. The Inca buildings that survive, such as the Qorikancha, reveal excellent workmanship, which we can also see in important buildings from other Inca sites. We know that Cuzco was the ceremonial, political and administrative centre of the empire, where grand <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/a/architecture.html','glos')">architecture</a></u></font> was built to impress visitors, but much of the city was destroyed after the Spanish conquest. Also, Spanish descriptions of Inca Cuzco are unreliable and it is difficult to carry out archaeological excavations of the city. These problems mean that there is still debate about the original layout of Cuzco and it is therefore difficult to get an idea of what the Inca capital looked like. However, because Machu Picchu is so well preserved it gives us a better understanding of Inca architecture and Inca cities, therefore helping us to understand Inca Cuzco.
