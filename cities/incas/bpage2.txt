The doors and windows of some buildings were seemingly made to frame views of the sacred mountains and some stones appear to be carved to echo the mountain shapes. Some experts think that Machu Picchu was built as a religious site where large ceremonies were held and therefore the sacred mountain setting would have been an ideal place for such a city.
