&tex=This Inca city was rediscovered by the archaeologist explorer, Hiram Bingham, in 1911. The world was fascinated by the accounts of the expedition which Bingham recorded in 'Lost City of the Incas'. The city, located in modern Peru, was never found by the Spanish when they conquered the Inca Empire in the sixteenth century, although it was probably known to local people. This means that Machu Picchu still contains original Inca buildings which can be studied by archaeologists to provide a clear picture of what an Inca city might have been like. This is particularly important as other Inca cities, such as the Inca capital, Cuzco, were largely demolished after the arrival of the Spanish, who used the foundations of Inca buildings to build their new cities. Also, Inca cities such as Cuzco are still home to many people, which means that excavations can not be carried out easily.
