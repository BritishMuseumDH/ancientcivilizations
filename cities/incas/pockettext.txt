We have imagined an account of Bingham's journey and discovery that might have been made by one of those expedition members, based on Bingham's own descriptions. </font face>
&text_2=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">The morning of July 24th found Bingham and the expedition team camped by the Urubamba river. Bingham was keen to get started, having been told by a local man, Arteaga, that ruins were to be found among the mountain peaks. Arteaga grumbled about the rain, but eventually they set off with Sergeant Carrasco, heading upriver. </font face>
&text_3=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">As they walked they passed a dead snake. To their dismay, they were informed that the region was home to many vipers!</font face>
&text_4=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">Soon they headed down to the riverbank and Bingham realized they needed to cross the foaming water by a very unsteady-looking bridge, made of logs lashed together. Below the bridge the river was squeezed between two boulders, creating tumbling <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/r/rapids.html','glos')"><u>rapids</u></a></font>. He knew if he slipped into those waters he would certainly drown and so carefully he edged across the bridge on his hands and knees, his heart thumping loudly. </font face>
&text_5=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">Bingham's relief at crossing the river safely was soon forgotten as they headed into dense jungle and then had to clamber up a steep slope, often again on all fours. In places ladders were secured to the slope to allow them to climb otherwise impossible parts of the route.</font face>
&text_6=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">By midday, exhausted, they reached a place to rest. Two thousand feet above the river was a grass-covered hut where they were welcomed by local farmers with water and sweet potatoes. Bingham learned that these farmers had discovered <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/t/terraces.html','glos')"><u>terraces</u></a></font> on which they could grow food. As they rested, Bingham marvelled at the view. They were surrounded by rocky cliffs and in the distance could be seen snow-topped mountains.</font face>
&text_7=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">The climb soon continued. They headed further up a <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/r/ridge.html','glos')"><u>ridge</u></a></font> and around a small <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/p/promontory.html','glos')"><u>promontory</u></a></font>. They were then met by the sight of about one hundred stone-faced terraces. These had been cleared by local farmers. They walked along one of the wider terraces and then into dense forest. Through the shadows, thickets of bamboo and trailing vines, Bingham glimpsed the ruins of houses revealing fine quality Inca stone-work using white granite.</font face>
&text_8=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">They scrambled further, climbing terrace walls and suddenly came upon a cave beneath a ledge, which was lined with fine cut stone. Bingham thought this may have been a royal <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/m/mausoleum.html','glos')"><u>mausoleum</u></a></font>. Above the ledge was a beautifully constructed semi-circular building, which reminded him of the Temple of the Sun in the Inca capital, Cuzco.</font face>
&text_9=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">Amazed by these finds, Bingham climbed another steep hill and came to a great stairway of granite blocks. From here they walked to a clearing to behold a sight that took Bingham's breath away. The ruins before him were two structures, built in white granite. Bingham thought them to be amongst the finest buildings in ancient America. He was spellbound. He was gazing upon Machu Picchu.  </font face>
