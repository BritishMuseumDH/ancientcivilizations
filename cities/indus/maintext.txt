&tex=The Indus Valley Civilization is well-known for having the earliest known planned cities.  Mohenjo-daro was one of the largest of these cities over four thousand years ago. It was a centre of trade and industry, as well as a bustling home to thousands of people.
Mohenjo-daro is a typical Indus Valley city as it has carefully laid out streets and clearly defined quarters.  Although much of the archaeological evidence from Mohenjo-daro is still not completely understood, it is possible to begin to learn a little bit about the way that people lived in the city and what was important to them by looking at the layout of the city and what was found there.
