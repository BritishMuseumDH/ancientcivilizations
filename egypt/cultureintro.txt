&tex=The civilization of Ancient Egypt dates back to around 3000 BC when the first pharaoh was established as ruler of Upper and Lower Egypt. Many different dynasties ruled the country over almost 3000 years, but in 332 BC it was conquered by Alexander the Great and so became part of the Greek world. 
Ancient Egypt developed one of the earliest forms of writing, hieroglyphics, but very few people could read and write. Only a certain group of people were allowed to train to be scribes.
Egyptian burial practices reveal information about religious beliefs, including the belief in an afterlife. This required the body to be preserved. We call this process mummification.
Although Egypt was well resourced with raw materials and could produce crops in the fertile soil of the Nile valley, it still needed trade with neighbouring countries to acquire things it needed, such as wood and metals.
Perhaps the most famous symbols of Ancient Egypt are the pyramids, built as tombs for pharaohs over four thousand years ago. We are still not certain about how they were constructed.
