&tex=The unified country of Germany only came into being in 1871, when many Germanic states came together under the leadership of the powerful state of Prussia. Before this time Germanic peoples had lived in a number of states that at times were brought together under one ruler or emperor. 
During the Middle Ages, which followed the collapse of the Roman Empire, much of western Europe, including the area of modern Germany, was united under the rule of the Frankish king, Charlemagne. On his death, his empire was split into three parts, with the area that makes up modern Germany going to Louis the German. This area was then split into five duchies. The first German king was Conrad I of Franconia, who came to power in AD 911. Under the Saxon king Otto the Great, the Germanic states formed part of the Holy Roman Empire. This, however, collapsed after internal wars broke out and the five duchies split into smaller powers. At this time some cities became ‘free’ cities, which formed powerful leagues. One of these was Mainz.
Mainz had become a free city in 1244 and as its size increased, it also became a centre of commerce, culture and learning. This was the climate in which Johannes Gutenberg lived, the man who invented the printing press and the use of movable type in Europe.
