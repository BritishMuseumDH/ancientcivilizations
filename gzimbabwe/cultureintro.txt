&tex=In 1872 a young German geologist named Carl Mauch visited a set of ruins in Zimbabwe.  He wrote in his diary: 
"I looked at what I believed to be out-buildings and found an object that was of iron.  Its use was a complete riddle to me, but it proves most clearly that a civilised nation must once have lived here. . . . No further information about the 'when' and 'how' could be obtained."
These ruins cover a huge area, around 1800 acres, and include large stone enclosures and buildings.  The Great Enclosure is extremely impressive.  It is constructed from approximately 900,000 stone blocks and the walls stand eleven metres high.  From the size of the site some archaeologists have suggested that the city might have had a population of around eighteen thousand people.
Research has suggested that the Shona people built the structures at Great Zimbabwe from A.D.1270 onwards and that the site was abandoned at some time between A.D.1420 and A.D.1450.  During this time Great Zimbabwe was an important link in the East African coastal trading.  Finds at Great Zimbabwe have shown that a trading network exported goods such as gold, ivory and iron and imported glass beads, cotton, glazed pottery and silk cloth which had been brought along the Silk Road.
Great Zimbabwe has become a symbol of the national pride of Zimbabwe.  The word Dzimbabwe is the Shona word for the house or grave of a chief and the country Zimbabwe takes its name from the numerous Dzimbabwes in this part of Africa.
