&tex=221 B.C. saw the birth of an empire, which was to become the longest surviving empire to date
Qin Shi Huangdi, the first Emperor, made several reforms that had a lasting influence on the Chinese Empire.  Old defensive walls in the North were joined to make the Great Wall, to stop invasion.  A single currency and uniform measures were introduced. Canal building and a road network made trade and travel much easier. 
Commercial links with the outside world increased.  The western route used to export silk and import horses soon became one of the most important trade routes in the world – the Silk Road. 
Buddhism was one of the imports that arrived from the Silk Road.  Along with Confucianism and Daoism, it formed one of the ‘Three Ways’.  This mixture of beliefs is still popular in China today. 
 Early Imperial China was the home of many great innovators.  Paper, printing, gunpowder and even earthquake detectors were invented in China during this period.
