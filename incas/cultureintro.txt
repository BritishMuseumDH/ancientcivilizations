&tex=The Incas are native people of the central Andes, a mountain range that runs down the western coast of South America. 
During the fifteenth century the Incas conquered many other native peoples and under the ruler Pachacuti they established a large empire with a population of nine million. Cuzco was the capital of the empire, which was ruled over by an emperor, called the Sapa Inca in Quechua, the Inca language. The Incas built a network of roads that enabled communication between far-flung corners of the empire. They did not develop a writing system but did have a system for record-keeping. This used knotted cords called ‘quipus’. 
Inca architecture involved very skilled stone-working and many palaces and temples still survive. The high standard of Inca architecture is shown in the city of Machu Picchu. When the Spanish conquered the Incas they destroyed many Inca buildings and rebuilt over some Inca settlements, including the capital, Cuzco. However, Machu Picchu was never found by the Spanish so its buildings have not been plundered for their stone and it provides important evidence about how Inca cities might have looked. The city may have had a particular function and it has been suggested that it was a religious site used for important ceremonies, as there are many temples and the stonework is of such high quality.
In the sixteenth century civil war weakened the empire and the Incas were conquered by the Spanish during the 1530s.
