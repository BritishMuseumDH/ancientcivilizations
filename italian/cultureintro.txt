&tex=The country we know as Italy has not always been a unified state. From the second century BC until the fall of Rome in AD 476, Italy was unified as part of the Roman Empire. During the Middle Ages, which followed the fall of the Roman Empire in western Europe, a number of city-states developed in Italy which, together with the pope, dominated the area. City-states were like small countries that had their own laws and government. Some of the city states in Italy became very powerful and wealthy. Others were famous for the art, literature and architecture that were produced there during a period called the Renaissance, which began in Italy in the 1300s. Some of the most well known and influential of the Italian City States during this time were Venice, Florence, Genoa, Pisa and Milan.
The city-state of Venice became very powerful because of its control of trade routes from Asia across the Mediterranean. It became the focus in Europe of the spice trade, which involved the transport of spice from India across land to ports around the eastern Mediterranean, from where Venetian ships brought it to Venice. Once here it was sold to European merchants at high prices.
