&tex=By the twelfth century AD the Japanese emperor and his court were no longer providing effective rule of the country. At this time the samurai, who were the warrior class in Japanese society, became powerful. They were loyal to powerful chiefs, called shoguns, who had effectively become the rulers of Japan and fought one another to gain more territory. The wars between the shoguns continued until the Tokugawa period, when one family of shoguns became the rulers of the whole country. This period lasted from 1603 until 1867, when the Tokugawa rulers were overthrown. The emperor was restored to power in 1868.
From their rise to power in the twelfth century, the samurai had complete control of the government until the return of the emperor as ruler, but they made up less than ten per cent of the population. The ideal samurai followed a code of conduct that placed bravery, honour and loyalty above life in importance. They wore two swords that symbolised their position in society. These were produced to a very high standard and sword makers held a prestigious position in society.
By 1871 the samurai class had lost their privileged position in Japanese society. By the end of the nineteenth century, some samurai families were living in poverty as their way of life was overtaken by the new urban culture of the growing cities.
