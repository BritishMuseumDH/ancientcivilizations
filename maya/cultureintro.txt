Much of our early knowledge of the ancient Mayan people came from the work of explorers who stumbled across ruins in the rain forest of southern Mexico and northern Central America.  Archaeologists think that the Mayan civilization began to develop in the first millennium B.C., but the main achievements of the Mayan people can be dated between A.D.200 and A.D.900.  
The Mayans were excellent builders, creating huge structures with finely carved reliefs and beautifully painted murals.  Recent work on the Mayan script has shown that they had a highly developed writing and counting system and an accurate system for recording time.  
No one really knows why certain Maya states collapsed in about the tenth century A.D.  Some historians say that it was because of drought or low food production, some suggest local warfare and others have suggested that a combination of these factors caused the decline.  The Maya were the last peoples to resist the Spanish and much of their culture survived despite the Spanish conquest.  Over seven million Maya live in the same region today.
