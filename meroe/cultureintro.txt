&tex=The kingdom of Meroe is not as well known as many of the ancient civilizations.  Nevertheless, the achievements of the Meroitic peoples are extremely important in the history of the African continent. 

During the late eighth century BC, when Egyptian influence abroad was relatively weak, the rulers of Napata, part of the ancient kingdom of Kush, were able to gain control of Egypt. They ruled both lands until 663 BC. Sometime in the sixth century it seems that the ruling house in Napata moved its capital to Meroe.  

We know very little about Meroitic history.  The information we have comes from archaeological evidence, a few inscriptions written in Egyptian hieroglyphs and from the records of other cultures that came into contact with the Meroitic peoples. These sources show that Meroe was occupied as early as the tenth century BC. It was located close to important trade routes and was the site of many monumental buildings. The kingdom was ruled by about eighty kings and queens until its collapse in the middle of the fourth century AD.

Life in Meroe was heavily influenced by the Egyptians. The people of Meroe used pyramids as the burial places for their kings and queens.  Although these pyramids were much smaller than many of those in Egypt, they served the same function. 

Meroe in turn influenced many of the civilizations that later dominated the African continent.
