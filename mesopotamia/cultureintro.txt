&tex=The word 'Mesopotamia' comes from the Greek language and means 'between the rivers'. The area known as Mesopotamia lies between two rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates. It now makes up part of modern Iraq and Syria. This area was home to several ancient civilizations: Sumer, Akkad, Babylonia and Assyria.
Mesopotamia used one of the most ancient forms of writing, called cuneiform. This script was incised onto many different materials including stone and clay. When it was discovered by archaeologists they were unable to read it. It was finally deciphered in the nineteenth century.
Mesopotamia did not have many natural resources so had to trade with other countries to get things that were needed, such as timber and precious metals.
During the Sumerian period monumental buildings were constructed as part of religious complexes. These took the form of stepped towers which are called ziggurats. They were also built by the Babylonians and Assyrians.
As part of the religious beliefs of the people of Mesopotamia, stories were produced that explained how gods created humans. These stories are called creation myths and they later found their way into many other cultures.
