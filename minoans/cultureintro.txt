&tex=When the archaeologist Arthur Evans started to dig in the area of Knossos on Crete, he was sure that he would find some important evidence of the people who lived on the island in the distant past.  After a few days he realised that he had found something much more important; a brand new civilization.
People had lived on Crete from about 7000B.C. and the island is home to some of the first settled towns in Europe.  From the beginning of the second millennium B.C. a change occurred in the way people lived on Crete.  A number of palaces were built on the island at Knossos, Malia, Phaistos and elsewhere.  The largest palace, excavated by Arthur Evans, was called by him 'The Palace of Minos at Knossos'.
Evans showed that the Minoans produced beautiful works of art such as frescoes in the palaces and fine pieces of jewellery.  He also traced pots and goods from Minoan Crete to Egypt and mainland Greece, proving that the Minoans had strong trading links with the civilizations that surrounded them.  The importance of trade and the growth of the palaces as administrative centres were linked to another development of the Minoans: the first written script in Europe.
Around 1530B.C. the volcanic island of Thera exploded.  The eruption showered northern Crete in volcanic ash.  This did not spell the end of Minoan Crete.  The Minoans recovered well but about fifty years later it seems that warfare caused the final downfall of the civilization.  The palaces were destroyed, many by fire, apart from Knossos which survived for another fifty years.  It too was ravaged by fire around 1375B.C.-1350B.C. and left in ruins, to be discovered again after 3500 years in the earth.
