&tex=The Mixtec were famous among other groups of people in Mexico for the quality of their arts.  The Aztec imported gold jewellery, fine masks of turquoise and finely-painted pottery from the Mixtec and even had Mixtec artists working in the Aztec city, Tenochtitlan, making exquisite objects for the nobles and ruling family.
Unlike the Aztec, the Mixtec people were not part of one large empire.  Instead there were several city states with their own kings related to each other by birth or marriage.  One of these kings was Eight Deer, the ruler of Tilantongo, made famous in the few Mixtec books to have survived until today.   It is these books that help us understand how the Mixtec lived, their beliefs and their history.
Archaeology also has found evidence of Mixtec culture.  One of the most famous discoveries was Tomb 7 at the city of Monte Alban.  This was the burial of a Mixtec king and the body was surrounded by objects of gold and silver, turquoise mosaics, necklaces of crystal, amber and semi-precious stones.
The Mixtec were never completely conquered by the Aztec.  Today Mixtec people still live in the same region of Mexico.
