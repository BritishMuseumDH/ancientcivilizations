&tex=One of the most spectacular archaeological finds ever made in Peru was the discovery of the tomb of a Moche ruler at Sipan, northern Peru.  The ruler had been buried in all his rich clothing and jewellery.  This showed his wealth and his role as religious and political leader of his people.
The Moche is one of several groups of people who created states in different river valleys along the desert coast of Peru over 1500 years ago.  The Moche used canals, aqueducts and irrigation systems to farm and they also fished the incredibly rich Pacific Ocean along their shores.  At their most powerful the Moche controlled all the valley states along the coast for about 550 kms.   Their Pyramid of the Sun, made of 130 million adobe bricks is the largest man-made structure in South America.
Apart from archaeological evidence we know about the Moche through their art that has survived, such as jewellery, a few textiles and wood sculpture and particularly through beautiful pottery.  Some are in the form of portraits of Moche rulers; others are decorated with fine painted scenes.  They give us an idea of Moche life and religious beliefs.
