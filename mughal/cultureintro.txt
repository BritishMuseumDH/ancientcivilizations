&tex=The Mughal Empire conjures images of great treasures and glittering architecture.
Ruling much of India for a quarter of a century, the rise of the Mughals begins with Babur. His short reign began when he invaded northern India from Afghanistan in 1526, but ended prematurely when he died after four, promising years in power. The succession of Babur’s son Humayun, only further undermined the stability of the young empire. It was not until Akbar’s reign (1556 – 1605) that the Mughals’ rule was truly secured. His skills as a tolerant and ambitious leader made for a successful and religiously stable empire. 
Under Jahangir (1605 – 1627), the empire continued to flourish and expand, whilst Shah Jahan’s reign (1628 – 1658) was characterized by his liking for precious jewels and elegant buildings. It was Shah Jahan’s love for his wife Mumtaz Mahal that inspired the world-famous Taj Mahal, a dramatic mausoleum delicately crafted in white marble. 
During Aurangzeb’s reign (1658 – 1707) the Mughal Empire began its decline which continued until it disappeared completely in 1858, when British control of India was absolute. Although no more, the Mughal legacy remains in the beautiful architecture, artworks and objects they left behind.
