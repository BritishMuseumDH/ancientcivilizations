&tex=Even before 6000 B.C. people had begun to settle on the Greek mainland in small farming villages.  There were many invasions of Greece between 6000 B.C. and 2000 B.C., but one in particular brought a new group of peoples with a new language, a distant form of the language we call Ancient Greek.  These invaders tried to make sure that they kept control over the areas they had conquered by building fortresses on hilltops.  These citadels were built at XXX
Around 1600 B.C. the people who had settled on the Greek mainland came into contact with the advanced Minoan culture based on Crete.  A number of the hilltop fortresses were turned into Palaces and XXXmostXXX show Minoan influences such as Minoan style frescoes and plumbing systems.  Palaces have been found at Tiryns, Athens, Thebes Pylos and most importantly at Mycenae, the palace which gives the civilization its name.
The Mycenaean civilization is famous for its writing system, Linear B, its trade network and the beautiful objects that were buried with its rulers in the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries B.C.  The reasons for the decline of the Mycenaean civilization are unclear although warfare and invasion seem likely.   The Palaces were destroyed, many by fire, by around 1200 B.C. apart from Mycenae itself which survived for another fifty years.  With the destruction of Mycenae the advances of the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations were lost only to be discovered again at the end of the nineteenth century.
