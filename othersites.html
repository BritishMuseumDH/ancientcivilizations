Ancient civilizations provide countless examples of human achievement. Human societies, from their earliest appearances through to their most complex communities, have faced questions common to all people.
<p>
A world-wide approach to the study of history can throw light on how different civilizations have solved these fundamental questions. As human societies constantly interact with one another, this approach also shows how later civilizations have built on previous achievements.
</p>
By linking our knowledge of key aspects of different civilizations, our understanding of human achievements is deepened and enhanced.

This unique website explores world themes of continuing importance to human development.
