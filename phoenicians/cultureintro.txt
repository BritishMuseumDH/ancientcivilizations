&tex=From around 1200 BC the Phoenicians, people who lived in the city states of Tyre, Sidon and Byblos in the eastern Mediterranean, became increasingly successful traders. They were expert sailors and traded with countries around the Mediterranean, including the Egyptians. The Phoenicians settled along the shores of the Mediterranean and set up trading colonies, including locations in north Africa, southern Spain and Sicily. One of their most famous colonies was Carthage, which remained powerful until its destruction by the Romans in 146 BC.
The Phoenicians developed the first real alphabet, which had twenty-two letters. This was adopted by the ancient Greeks and is the basis for the Latin alphabet used today. However, very few books or written documents about Phoenician history survive.  Only Phoenician inscriptions and information provided by Roman and Greek authors remain.
The Phoenician homelands in the eastern Mediterranean became part of the Assyrian, Babylonian and Persian empires, but their way of life finally ended when they were conquered by the Greek king Alexander the Great.
