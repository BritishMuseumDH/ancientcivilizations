&tex=It was one place the fierce Roman legions did not want to go: Britain.  For the Romans, Britain was across the sea and full of strange and dangerous people.  Julius Caesar had fought battles in Britain in 55 and 54 BC, but Rome did not fully control any part of Britain until the emperor Claudius’ invasion in AD 43.
For fifty years after the invasion of Claudius, the Roman forces gradually conquered the area covered by modern England and Wales. The northern frontier was guarded by forts and, from the early second century, additionally by Hadrian’s Wall. One of the forts that protected the northern frontier was Vindolanda, where archaeologists have found letters and official records written by the people of the fort on thin wooden tablets.
Roman rule changed Britain.  Roads soon crossed the country, towns developed along with new technology and the Roman way of life was adopted by many people in Britain. Roman villas were constructed in the countryside by wealthy Romano-Britons. These villas, and houses in the towns, made use of Roman technologies such as a central heating system and mosaic floors. 
During the third century AD, parts of the Roman Empire including Britain were attacked by tribes living beyond the Roman frontiers.  There were many raids on Roman territory in the fourth century and by AD 410 the Romans decided to pull all of their remaining troops out of Britain. The Roman soldiers and administration departed and the people of Britain were left to look after themselves. However, the Roman way of life continued well beyond AD 410.
