        <p><b>The Silver Bowls<br>
          </b>These objects have, like the spoons, been given Christian significance 
          because they are decorated with an equal-armed cross. However, some 
          experts don't believe that this decoration was meant to be seen as a 
          Christian symbol and instead think that the bowls are another indication 
          of wealth. Of the ten bowls, eight in particular survived well as they 
          were stacked inside each other and were placed upside down in the grave. 
          They come from the Byzantine world.</p>
