        <p><b>The Belt Buckle<br>
          </b>This is a very large gold buckle that weighs over 400g. The decoration 
          uses intricate animal and bird-based designs. The buckle can be opened, 
          so could have contained objects, such as Christian relics. Like the 
          purse lid, experts think that the object was made in England by a master 
          craftsman, as the object displays a very high standard of workmanship. 
          Being able to commission such objects shows that the king was very wealthy.</p>
