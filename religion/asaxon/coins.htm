        <p><b>The Coins<br>
          </b>Thirty-seven small gold coins were found with the purse lid. There 
          were also three gold blanks which would have been made into coins and 
          two small gold bars. The coins came from Gaul, which consisted of modern 
          France, Belgium and part of Germany. Experts have decided that the coins 
          date from AD 575 to AD 625. This information has been very important 
          in dating the burial and therefore in helping to identify the king for 
          whom the treasure was buried. The coins were all individually chosen 
          as they came from different mints. They were possibly meant to symbolize 
          the king's wealth, but other experts think that the money was to be 
          used by the dead king in the afterlife to pay the men that would row 
          and steer his boat to its destinationXXX. In this sense the coins tell 
          us about the beliefs of the people who buried the king.</p>
