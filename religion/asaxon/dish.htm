        <p><b>The Anastasius Dish<br>
          </b>There were sixteen pieces of silver buried in the grave and this 
          dish is the largest of them all. It has a diameter of 72.4 cm and was 
          made from one lump of silver! The dish has been impressed with a stamp 
          of Emperor Anastasius I, who ruled between AD 491 and 518, so the dish 
          was already very old by the time it was placed in the burial. Like the 
          other silverware, this object came from the Byzantine Empire.</p>
