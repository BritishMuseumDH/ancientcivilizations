        <p><b>The Helmet<br>
          </b>The helmet, when found, was in hundreds of pieces and has been carefully 
          reconstructed. It was made of iron but was decorated with embossed bronze 
          sheeting coated with tin, which would have given it a silvery appearance. 
          The replica shows how impressive the helmet would have been when made. 
          The decoration is Swedish in style and the bronze plates may have been 
          made by Swedish craftsmen. The helmet shows the warrior status of the 
          man who was buried.</p>
