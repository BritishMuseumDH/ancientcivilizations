&tex=The ways in which different cultures bury their dead can give us clues about their religious beliefs. Changes in burial practices in a particular area can also provide evidence of a change in beliefs. This is true of burial sites in Britain which show evidence of new religious ideas connected with Christianity. However, the change to Christianity was a gradual change; people did not immediately abandon their earlier beliefs.
The Anglo-Saxons, when they came to Britain, were pagans, believing in many gods. Pagan beliefs influenced the way that the Anglo-Saxons buried their dead. They included many objects in the grave which they thought could be used by the dead person in the afterlife. When the Anglo-Saxons converted to Christianity, their burial practices changed. They no longer buried objects with the person as this went against Christian beliefs.
