object_1=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14"><B>The Helmet: </B><BR><BR>The helmet, when found, was in hundreds of pieces and has been carefully <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/r/reconstructed.html','glos')"><u>reconstructed</u></a></font>. It was made of iron but was decorated with <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/emboss.html','glos')"><u>embossed</u></a></font> bronze sheeting coated with tin, which would have given it a silvery appearance.The <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/r/replica.html','glos')"><u>replica</u></a></font> shows how impressive the helmet would have been when made. The decoration is Swedish in style and the bronze plates may have been made by Swedish craftsmen. The helmet shows the warrior <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/status.html','glos')"><u>status</u></a></font> of the man who was buried.</font face>

&object_2=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14"><B>The Shield: </B><BR><BR>This was in pieces when found, like the helmet, and has been <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/r/reconstructed.html','glos')"><u>reconstructed</u></a></font>. The shield would have been made of limewood covered with animal hide. There was an iron boss in the middle. This was probably intended for display purposes, not for actual fighting, as it was made of rich materials, some of which are quite fragile. Like the helmet, it was probably made by Swedish <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/a/armourer.html','glos')"><u>armourers</u></a></font> or perhaps in Sweden. The shield also displayed the warrior <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/status.html','glos')"><u>status</u></a></font> of the man, who had a complete set of <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/m/military.html','glos')"><u>military</u></a></font> equipment buried with him. This emphasised his royalty.</font face>

&object_3=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14"><B>The Sword: </B><BR><BR>In Anglo-Saxon pagan burials, men were usually buried with weapons, but swords are not often found in graves by archaeologists. It seems that men buried with swords were of a high <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/status.html','glos')"><u>status</u></a></font> in society and clearly a king would be expected to be buried with his. The sword was made of iron and was <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/p/pattern_welded.html','glos')"><u>'pattern-welded'</u></a></font>. This type of sword was highly prized and was often handed down in families. The worth of the object can also be judged by the use of gold and <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/g/garnet.html','glos')"><u>garnet fittings</u></a></font>.</font face>

&object_4=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14"><B>The Purse Lid: </B><BR><BR>The purse lid is made of a kidney-shaped piece of whale bone surrounded by a gold frame, with seven decorative gold plaques set with <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/g/garnet.html','glos')"><u>garnets</u></a></font> and <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/m/mille_glass.html','glos')"><u>millefiori glass</u></a></font>. The actual purse has <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/d/disintegrated.html','glos')"><u>disintegrated</u></a></font> but was probably a pouch-like bag that hung below the lid. It is a beautifully made object and experts think it was probably made by the king’s own jewellers. The fact that he had master craftsmen working for him using precious materials demonstrates the wealth of the king.</font face>

&object_5=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14"><B>The Belt Buckle: </B><BR><BR>This is a very large gold buckle that weighs over 400g. The decoration uses intricate animal and bird-based designs. The buckle can be opened, so could have contained objects, such as Christian <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/r/relics.html','glos')"><u>relics</u></a></font>. Like the purse lid, experts think that the object was made in England by a master craftsman, as the object displays a very high standard of workmanship. Being able to <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/commission.html','glos')"><u>commission</u></a></font> such objects shows that the king was very wealthy.</font face>


&object_6=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14"><B>The Coins: </B><BR><BR>Thirty-seven small gold coins were found with the purse lid. There were also three gold blanks which would have been made into coins and two small gold bars. The coins came from <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/g/gaul.html','glos')"><u>Gaul</u></a></font>. Experts have decided that the coins date from AD 575 to AD 625. This information has been very important in dating the burial and therefore in helping to identify the king for whom the treasure was buried. They were possibly meant to symbolize the king's wealth, but other experts think that the money was to be used by the dead king in the afterlife to pay the men that would row and steer his boat to its destination. In this sense the coins tell us about the beliefs of the people who buried the king.</font face>

There were also three gold blanks which would have been made into coins and two small gold bars. The coins came from Gaul, which consisted of modern France, Belgium and part of Germany.

&object_7=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14"><B>The Ceremonial Whetstone: </B><BR><BR>This is a rather mysterious object whose purpose is uncertain. It consists of a whetstone and, probably fixed to one end of this, a bronze stag and ring. The whetstone, which is a stone used to sharpen cutting tools, had not been used. Some experts have decided that this object might have been a sceptre, which is an object associated with kingship that symbolizes royal authority. It may well have been a symbol of power and part of the royal <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/r/regalia.html','glos')"><u>regalia</u></a></font>.</font face>

&object_8=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14"><B>The Silver Spoons: </B><BR><BR>These two silver spoons are inscribed with two names, Saul and Paul. For this reason they have been seen as having a Christian significance and have led to suggestions that, despite the pagan nature of the burial, the buried king had been baptized. The reason for this is that Saul is known from the Bible for having converted to Christianity as a result of a vision, while on the road to Damascus. He then changed his name to Paul. The two spoons would therefore have been suitable as a baptismal present for a convert to Christianity. However, East Anglia had only just begun to accept Christianity in the early seventh century and so other experts have suggested that these objects may have been simply a gift with no intended Christian meaning. Along with the other silver objects, the spoons come from the <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/b/byzantine_emp.html','glos')"><u>Byzantine Empire</u></a></font>, showing the considerable contacts with other countries that the king had.</font face>

&object_9=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14"><B>The Silver Bowls: </B><BR><BR>These objects have, like the spoons, been given Christian significance because they are decorated with an equal-armed cross. However, some experts don’t believe that this decoration was meant to be seen as a Christian symbol and instead think that the bowls are another indication of wealth. Of the ten bowls, eight in particular survived well as they were stacked inside each other and were placed upside down in the grave. They come from the <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/b/byzantine_emp.html','glos')"><u>Byzantine world</u></a></font>.</font face>

&object_10=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14"><B>The Hanging Bowls: </B><BR><BR>These bronze hanging bowls come from the Celtic world, which included parts of western Britain, Wales and Ireland. The largest one originally hung from the wall of the burial chamber before it collapsed. The function of these bowls is not certain. These were highly prized objects and are found in other high <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/status.html','glos')"><u>status</u></a></font> graves.</font face>

&object_11=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14"><B>The Coptic Bowl: </B><BR><BR>This bowl is called 'Coptic' because there were many workshops making this sort of object in <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/coptic.html','glos')"><u>Coptic</u></a></font> Egypt. However, it now seems that there were workshops producing such bronzes over a wider area of the east Mediterranean than just Coptic Egypt. As with the Byzantine and Celtic objects and those from Gaul and possibly Sweden, this object shows the wide range of contacts that a high <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/status.html','glos')"><u>status</u></a></font> king had, although these contacts were not necessarily direct.</font face>

&object_12=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14"><B>The Anastasius Dish: </B><BR><BR>There were sixteen pieces of silver buried in the grave and this dish is the largest of them all. It has a diameter of 72.4 cm and was made from one lump of silver! The dish has been <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/i/impressed.html','glos')"><u>impressed</u></a></font> with a stamp of Emperor Anastasius I, who ruled between AD 491 and 518, so the dish was already very old by the time it was placed in the burial. Like the other silverware, this object came from the <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/b/byzantine_emp.html','glos')"><u>Byzantine Empire</u></a></font>.</font face>

&object_13=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14"><B>The Maplewood Bottles: </B><BR><BR>These bottles made from Maplewood were produced as a set and had matching silver pieces around the neck. The bottles, and the drinking horns laid with them, are similar to examples found in another rich grave at Taplow in Buckinghamshire.</font face>
