        <p><b>The Shield<br>
          </b>This was in pieces when found, like the helmet, and has been reconstructed. 
          The shield would have been made of limewood covered with animal hide. 
          There was an iron boss in the middle. This was probably intended for 
          display purposes, not for actual fighting, as it was made of rich materials, 
          some of which are quite fragile. Like the helmet, it was probably made 
          by Swedish armourers or perhaps in Sweden. The shield also displayed 
          the warrior status of the man, who had a complete set of military equipment 
          buried with him. This emphasised his royalty.</p>
