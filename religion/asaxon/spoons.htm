        <p><b>The Silver Spoons<br>
          </b>These two silver spoons are inscribed with two names, Saul and Paul. 
          For this reason they have been seen as having a Christian significance 
          and have led to suggestions that, despite the pagan nature of the burial, 
          the buried king had been baptized. The reason for this is that Saul 
          is known from the Bible for having converted to Christianity as a result 
          of a vision, while on the road to Damascus. He then changed his name 
          to Paul. The two spoons would therefore have been suitable as a baptismal 
          present for a convert to Christianity. However, East Anglia had only 
          just begun to accept Christianity in the early seventh century and so 
          other experts have suggested that these objects may have been simply 
          a gift with no intended Christian meaning. Along with the other silver 
          objects, the spoons come from the Byzantine Empire, showing the considerable 
          contacts with other countries that the king had.</p>
