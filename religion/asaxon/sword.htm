        <p><b>The Sword<br>
          </b>In Anglo-Saxon pagan burials, men were usually buried with weapons, 
          but swords are not often found in graves by archaeologists. It seems 
          that men buried with swords were of a high status in society and clearly 
          a king would be expected to be buried with his. The sword was made of 
          iron and was 'pattern-welded'. This type of sword was highly prized 
          and was often handed down in families. The worth of the object can also 
          be judged by the use of gold and garnet fittings.</p>
