<p class="mainText">This part of the icon actually shows another icon that was one of the most famous in Constantinople. It shows Mary and the infant Jesus. It was claimed that this icon was painted by Saint Luke of the real Mary, so it showed her actual appearance. The icon sits on a stand draped in red cloth, with red curtains pulled back on either side of it. Two figures with wings hold the icon on each side; these are not thought to be angels, but people dressed as angels holding up the icon for people to see.</p>
