<p class="mainText">The five people shown here were all supporters of the use of icons in churches, but we are not certain of all their names. The person on the extreme left is Saint Theodosia. She is holding an icon of Jesus and is dressed as a nun. The inscriptions of the names for the next three people cannot be read. The fifth person seems to be Saint Theophanes. He is also holding an icon of Jesus.</p>
