<p class="mainText">Not all these people would have been alive in 843. For instance St. THeodore, one of the greatest supporters of the use of icons, died in 829, so did not live to see the Triumph of Orthodoxy. He is probably the figure closest to the middle of the icon, who holds the icon of Jesus together with Saint Theophanes. The next figure in white is a bishop. The names of the next two people are not certain but the last two appear to be Saint Theophilaktos the Confessor and Saint Arsakios.</p>
