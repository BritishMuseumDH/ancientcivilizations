<p class="mainText">Icons were painted onto a wooden panel which was covered with gesso, a type of plaster of Paris, and linen. This in turn was covered with gold leaf to give the icon its glowing appearance. The picture was painted onto the gold leaf in egg tempera, which is a powdered colour mixed with egg yolk and water.</p>
