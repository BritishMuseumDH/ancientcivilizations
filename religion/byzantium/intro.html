<p class="titleText">Explore an icon from Byzantium</p>

<p class="mainText">This icon is called 'The Triumph of Orthodoxy'. The title refers to a period called Iconoclasm, when pictures of any religious person were banned in Byzantium. This meant that icons, such as the one shown below, could not be displayed in churches and some were destroyed. Iconoclasm was eventually ended in AD 843, when holy images were once more allowed in churches. This icon celebrates the victory of Orthodoxy, or 'right practice', which in this case was the part of the church that supported the use of icons, over the iconoclasts, who were the people who wanted icons to remain banned.</p>
