text_1=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="12">This icon celebrates the ending of a period called Iconoclasm, when pictures of any religious person were banned in Byzantium. This meant that icons, such as this one, could not be displayed in churches and some were destroyed. Iconoclasm was eventually ended in AD 843, when holy images were once more allowed in churches.</font>

&text_3=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="12">This part of the icon actually shows another icon that was one of the most famous in Constantinople. It shows Mary and the infant Jesus. It was claimed that this icon was painted by <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/saint_luke.html','glos')"><u>Saint Luke</u></a></font> and showed what the real Mary looked like. The icon sits on a stand draped in red cloth, with red curtains pulled back on either side of it. Two figures with wings hold the icon on each side; these are not thought to be angels, but people dressed as angels holding up the icon for people to see.</font>
&text_4=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="12">These two people were the rulers of Byzantium at the end of Iconoclasm. The child is Emperor Michael III and the adult is his mother, Empress Theodora. They wear suitable regal robes and crowns.</font>
&text_5=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="12">The figure nearest to the icon is the Patriarch Methodios, who was the chief bishop in Constantinople at the end of Iconoclasm. Next to him stand three monks.</font>
&text_6=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="12">The five people shown here were all supporters of the use of icons in churches, but we are not certain of all their names. The person on the extreme left is Saint Theodosia. She is holding an icon of Jesus and is dressed as a nun. The inscriptions of the names for the next three people cannot be read. The fifth person seems to be Saint Theophanes. He is also holding an icon of Jesus. </font>
&text_7=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="12">Not all these people would have been alive in 843. For instance St. Theodore, one of the greatest supporters of the use of icons, died in 829, so did not live to see the Triumph of Orthodoxy. He is probably the figure closest to the middle of the icon, who holds the icon of Jesus together with Saint Theophanes. The next figure in white is a bishop. The names of the next two people are not certain but the last two appear to be Saint Theophilaktos the Confessor and Saint Arsakios.</font>
&text_8=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="12">Icons were painted onto a wooden panel which was covered with gesso, a type of plaster of Paris, and <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/l/linen.html','glos')"><u>linen</u></a></font>. This in turn was covered with <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/g/gold_leaf.html','glos')"><u>gold leaf</u></a></font> to give the icon its glowing appearance. The picture was painted onto the gold leaf in egg tempera, which is a powdered colour mixed with egg yolk and water.</font>

&text_10=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="12">This icon is called the 'Triumph of Orthodoxy'. The word orthodoxy means 'right practice' and refers in this case to the practice of using icons. The 'triumph' was the defeat of the iconoclasts, who were the people who wanted icons to remain banned.</font>
