&tex=China was unusual in that instead of having one dominant belief system, it was influenced by three different religions. These three beliefs were Confucianism, Daoism and Buddhism.  
Followers of Confucianism believed in the teachings of Confucius. Confucius was born in 551 B.C. He believed that disorder could only be averted by upholding traditional hierarchies and rituals. 
Daoism is the belief that one must follow the 'Way' (or Dao) - the force or energy that is the source of all that happens. Daoists believe that people should lead simple lives and not disrupt the balance of the natural world.
Buddhism was the last of the religions to gain influence in China. In order to fit in with the other two established belief systems - Buddhism in China became subtly different to Buddhism in India.  For example, the Buddhist teaching of severing all family ties was abandoned as it clashed with the existing Confucian belief.
