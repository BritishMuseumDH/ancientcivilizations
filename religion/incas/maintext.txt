&tex=The actions that people carry out as part of their religious worship can give us a clearer picture of their religious beliefs. In many religions pilgrimage is undertaken as a means of showing devotion to or love of a god. This involves a journey being made to a special place that is sacred to a deity. Offerings might then be made to the god to ensure their continued support and help.
In Inca religion, pilgrimage was undertaken to sacred places or shrines that were natural features of the landscape, like caves, lakes, rivers and particularly mountains. These places were thought to have special powers and were called wak’as by the Incas. The wak’as were important as gods. The Inca pilgrimages to wak’as sometimes involved making offerings of things like food, drink and precious objects, including human figurines dressed in miniature clothing. Sometimes the offering was a human sacrifice to honour the sacred mountain and ensure its future support. In modern times, the people of the Andes still carry out pilgrimages to mountain shrines, where they light candles and offer prayers to god.
