&tex=As a culture or civilization grows its people come into contact with cultures different from their own.  Contact between different cultures can bring war and destruction or trade, friendship and the spread of ideas and beliefs.       
As the Egyptian empire expanded to the south and took control of the land later known as Nubia, it spread its beliefs and religious practices to this area.  Although the people of Nubia already had their own religious customs their rulers adopted many of the Egyptian ways and beliefs. This influence continued even after the collapse of the Egyptian empire in about 1070 BC.

These rulers were buried in pyramids like their early Egyptian counterparts, although the shape and size of these pyramids were different. The pyramids included <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/f/funerary_chap.html','glos')">funerary chapels</a></u></font> which were decorated with images of the rulers performing <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/r/ritual.html','glos')">rituals</a></u></font>, as well as images of gods and goddesses.

&content1=Queen Shanakdakhete, the first queen of Meroe is seated on the lion throne.  
Lions had always been connected to the kings of Egypt. As well as this connection, in Egyptian belief, the lion-god Aker guarded the gateway to the underworld. Ancient Egyptians believed that the Sun passed through this gateway and therefore died and was reborn every day.  The lion came to represent death and rebirth and can be found on many funerary couches and tables.

&content1b=This statue of a lion demonstrates the influence of the Egyptian pharaohs on the <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/m/meroitic.html','glos')">Meroitic</a></u></font> kings and queens.
