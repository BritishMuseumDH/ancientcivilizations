&tex=16th century India was a diverse land with many different religions living alongside each other - not always in harmony. When the Mughals invaded in the early 16th century, they came as Muslims. However different emperors approached issues of religion in different ways. 
The third Mughal emperor, Akbar, was a tolerant man, eager to learn of different religions and customs. He married Hindu wives and warmly welcomed missionary Jesuit priest from Europe. Akbar even developed a new religion centered on himself, in an attempt to take the best from several faiths. This accommodating attitude made for a stable, harmonious kingdom. 
By contrast, Aurangzeb who reigned between 1658 and 1707, was a strict Muslim. He was keen to pull the empire back round to Islamic law and customs – which proved unpopular with his largely Hindu subjects.
Each Mughal emperor’s attitude to religion, coloured their reign in different ways. The coinage they left behind can tell us much about their different attitudes.
