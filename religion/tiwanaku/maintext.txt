&tex=The Andes mountains of South America were home to many <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/c/culture.html','glos')">cultures</a></u></font> before the rise of the well-known <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/i/inca_emp.html','glos')">Inca Empire</a></u></font> in the fifteenth century. Some aspects of these earlier cultures, such as their religious beliefs, show similarities with the Inca civilization, demonstrating that the Incas incorporated elements of cultures that had existed previously. It is therefore important for us to understand the variety of cultures that lived in the Andes and the influence that they had on one another.
The culture based on the city of Tiwanaku in modern <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/b/bolivia.html','glos')">Bolivia</a></u></font> developed religious buildings that were closely linked with their view of the world, particularly their beliefs concerning the landscape around them. We see this belief in a sacred landscape held by the Incas as well. Tiwanaku contained a <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/s/sacred.html','glos')">sacred</a></u></font> area that was separated by a moat from the rest of the city. This probably created an island that was like the Island of the Sun on <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/l/lake_titicaca.html','glos')">Lake Titicaca</a></u></font>. Myths from later cultures tell us that this was thought to be the place where humans were created and so perhaps it had an important place in Tiwanaku beliefs. In the sacred area was the largest and most impressive building of Tiwanaku, the Akapana.
