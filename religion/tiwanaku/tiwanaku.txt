&construct_intro=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="12">Akapana was a pyramid-shaped stepped mound.

&construct_top=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="12">On the topmost terrace was a sunken court.</font>
&construct_mid=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="12">On the six upper terraces of the structure there were panels on the faces of the terrace walls. It is thought that these might have been covered with decorated metal plaques or textiles. The terrace walls also had sculptures of puma and human heads inserted into them.</font>
&construct_bottom=The cut stones used for the retaining walls of the terraces were fitted together without <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/m/mortar.html','glos')"><u>mortar</u></a></font>, so they had to be cut with great precision to ensure that they fitted together perfectly.</font>

&religion_intro=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="12">Akapana was an important shrine in Tiwanaku religion and was a place where <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/r/ritual.html','glos')"><u>ritual</u></a></font> activities could be carried out. The building also served as a burial place for particular groups of people.<br><br>Explore this model by clicking the red areas for more information.</font>
&religion_top=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="12">On the top of the terraces were living quarters which are thought to have belonged to priests that carried out the rituals on the summit of Akapana. Burials were found beneath the patio of the living quarters.<br><br>A line of adults wrapped tightly in textile bundles was found facing a seated male who was holding an incense burner. These burials are thought to belong to members of the <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/elite.html','glos')"><u>elite</u></a></font> in Tiwanaku.</font>
&religion_lower=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="12">On some of the lower terraces buildings were erected, but their function is not clear. </font>
&religion_foundations=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="12">Amongst the foundations of the building were found human burials, which had been placed in Akapana as <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/o/offering.html','glos')"><u>offerings</u></a></font>. Many of the burials were without skulls and sometimes other bones. Experts think that these people had died or were <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/sacrifice.html','glos')"><u>sacrificed</u></a></font> and were later buried at Akapana. When they were buried it is thought the skulls were removed because heads were often taken as trophies in Tiwanaku warfare and sacrifice. <br><br>Heads were believed to be sacred so by taking them the people of Tiwanaku gained power over this group. It is suggested that the skeletons could belong to the ancestors of a conquered people and by placing them at the base of Tiwanaku's main shrine it <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/symbolised.html','glos')"><u>symbolised</u></a></font> Tiwanaku's control of this group of people.</font>

&fountain_intro=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="12">The Akapana fountain suggests the huge importance of water to the people of Tiwanaku.<br><br>Explore this model by clicking the red areas for more information.</font>
&fountain_top=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="12">The sunken court on the top of the Akapana would have filled with water during the rainy season. This had to be drained and therefore could be used to create a flow of water.</font>
&fountain_diag1=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="12">The water was channelled inside the structure from the sunken court and then flowed to the next terrace down.</font>
&fountain_diag2=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="12">Here it came out from the terrace wall and poured down into a channel on the horizontal terrace where it flowed a few metres before going into another drain.</font>
&fountain_diag3=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="12">This vertical drain took the water back inside the structure and down to the next level where the water would appear again following the pattern described above.</font>
&fountain_bottom=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="12">Eventually the water came out at the bottom terrace through tunnels. This system of drainage was more complicated than it needed to be and experts think that the reason for this is that the flowing water had a symbolic function.</font>
&meaning_title=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">What do we think Akapana meant to the people of Tiwanaku?</font>
&meaning=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">Akapana seems to have had an important role as a symbol of what was important or sacred to the people of Tiwanaku. We know that mountains were sacred to these people, partly because they were the source of the water that was needed for humans and crops, and experts now believe that Akapana <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/symbolised.html','glos')"><u>symbolised</u></a></font> a sacred mountain. There are several reasons for thinking this.<br><br>Firstly, Akapana was shaped to echo the form of a mountain. Also, inside the structure green gravel was deliberately placed in thin layers between the clay. It is thought that this gravel was of symbolic importance as it had been brought down from the sacred mountains by streams. Also it was the colour of water, which was vital for life to flourish in Tiwanaku. <br><br>The mountain symbolism also relates to the Akapana fountain. Experts think that the fountain of water in the rainy season reflected the fact that the sacred mountain range to the south of Tiwanaku also produced a fountain-like flow of water at this time. The water on the mountains created pools which drained into underground streams and then appeared at various stages lower down the mountain. On reaching the mountain foot, these mountain streams and springs were the source of water for drinking and for irrigating the fields during the main growing season for the crops. <br><br>This suggests that Akapana was not just symbolising the sacred mountains but also the mountains as sources of water. By imitating the mountains which were so important to Tiwanaku it is thought that Tiwanaku tried to show control over this crucial place in the natural world.</font>
