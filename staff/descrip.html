<p>The site in organized into six themes. These are accessed via the Themes Home page. This page can be reached at any point by clicking on the museum icon at the bottom of the page. Each theme links to a theme map, which displays those cultures selected to illustrate that theme. </p>

<p>The appearance of the cultures on the map is governed by the timeline. The timeline appears automatically the first time the user enters the Theme map. The cultures appear and disappear over time as the timeline is moved back and forth. The timeline can be opened by clicking the pocket watch icon. </p>

<p>The content for a particular culture within each theme is reached by clicking the culture name on the map. This links to the introduction for the main culture content. From this introduction, which connects the theme to the particular culture, the user can access the main content by clicking on the left hand link or picture.</p>

<p>The site also contains an A-Z of Cultures. This is accessed via the globe icon. When a culture is selected, a menu will appear which provides links to all the themed content for that culture. </p>
