<h3>How many people would have worked in the workshop?</h3>

The bronze industry in China must have been very large and well organised.  Hundreds of men would have been employed in the mining and <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/smelting.html','smel')">smelting</a> of metal for the bronze vessels.
