<h3>What objects were made from bronze?</h3>

<p>
Many weapons were cast from bronze.  The moulds needed to make weapons were very simple, so large numbers of blades, halberds and daggers could be cast.
</p>
They also made bronze vessels for food, wine and water.  These were to be used at special ancestor rituals.  Food and drink was offered to the ancestors in these beautiful vessels.  They hoped that using such precious vessels would impress their ancestors, and that the ancestors would then bring them good fortune.
