&tex=In Ancient China bronze and jade were highly prized materials. From the Shang dynasty (1500 - 1050 B.C.) onwards, bronze was cast into many intricately decorated vessels and weapons. Jade was carved into sophisticated pendants and ornaments. The level of craftsmanship shown in China led to the ninth century Arab author, Jahiz of Basra, commenting that the Turks had the greatest soldiers in the world, the Persians had the greatest kings, but China had the most talented craftspeople.
