&tex=New technologies can have an impact on the artistic achievements of a particular civilization. If a new technology allows materials, such as metal, to be used in different ways then those materials can be used to create new works of art. In Benin, the technology of brass casting dates back to the fourteenth century and flourished in the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc and was seen as a precious metal. The skill of casting brass was linked to the royal courts and the inherited power of the king. Court officials and vassal kingdoms were given brass insignia and it was also traded as a luxury good. The method used to cast the brass is called the lost wax method and it is still used today.
