&tex=The ancient Egyptians are well known for the large stone structures they built called 'pyramids'. Pyramids were built as tombs for the rulers of Egypt during a period of time that spanned hundreds of years, beginning in about 2600 BC.
Pyramids are some of the most well-known structures which survive from the ancient world. They have been the subject of fascination, exploration and study for hundreds of years, yet we are still not sure how they were built. The design, labour and construction involved with a project of this size has baffled people trying to understand the pyramids. Through learning about one theory of how they were built, it is possible to begin to understand what a monumental achievement it was to build the pyramids.
