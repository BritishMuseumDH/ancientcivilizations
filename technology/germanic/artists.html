<p class="mainText">Printing using woodblocks was not only used by book publishers. Artists also used wood blocks in which they carged pictures. These were inked, as would be done with a block of text, and paper was laid onto the block and rubbed to create a printed picture. The example here is a woodcut by the German artist Albrecht D&uuml;rer. The subject comes from Greek myth and shows the hero Hercules with three other figures. With the actual woodcut (the printed picture on paper) you can see the woodblock on which the picture was carved before being inked and then printed.</p>
