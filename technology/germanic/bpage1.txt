tex=The Renaissance was a period which began in the early fourteenth century in Italy. It saw the revival of art and learning, inspired by the classical age of ancient Greece and Rome.
After the invention of the printing press, the machine spread throughout Europe. By 1500 there were well over one hundred presses in Italy. One of the most famous was the Aldine Press which aimed to print texts by classical writers in the original Greek or Latin. This meant that the work of the philosophers and writers of Greece and Rome could reach a new audience who could afford printed books. Furthermore, whereas handwritten books were usually written in Latin, increasing numbers of printed books were produced in the native language of a country. This meant that those people who had not had a classical education and learnt Latin were able to read books themselves, including Renaissance works containing new ideas about art and architecture and the translated works of Greek and Roman writers. 
However, books concerning religious teachings were printed in greater numbers than those containing classical texts and Renaissance thinking. Throughout Europe, printed works were used to spread religious ideas during the Renaissance. In the North, especially Germany, this led to the Reformation. Therefore religion was often the driving force behind the spread of the printing press, but the invention did also give wider access to new Renaissance ideas, including important works on medicine and astronomy.
