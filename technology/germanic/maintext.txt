&tex=Technology can have a big effect on people’s lives. For example, the internet has allowed people to have access to a huge range of information from the comfort of their own homes.  Before computers the main source of acquiring specific information was books. However, books were not always as easily available as they are now. In Europe during Medieval times, all books were handwritten, often by monks, which meant that they were not easy to get hold of and were very expensive. However, one very important invention meant that books could be made quickly and more cheaply. This allowed many more people access to information. This invention was the printing press.
