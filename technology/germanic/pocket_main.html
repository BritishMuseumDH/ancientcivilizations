      <p class="titleText">Block Printing</p>

      <p class="mainText">Printing was first invented by the Chinese in the seventh century, a long time before the invention of the printing press. The Chinese method used blocks of wood that had pictures and writing carved into them. They were then inked before paper was laid onto the blocks and rubbed so that the ink soaked into the paper. This method of block printing reached Europe in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p class="captionText">This is a European example of a woodblock, used to print a picture onto paper.</p>
