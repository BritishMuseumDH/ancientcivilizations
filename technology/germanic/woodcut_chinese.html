<p class="titleText">A Chinese Woodcut</p>

<p class="mainText">This block print (called a woodcut) was produced in China in the tenth century AD. It includes a picture with text using Chinese characters. The text contains a prayer; a lot of early Chinese printing was fuelled by a desire to spread religious information. Colour has been added by hand after the page was printed.</p>
