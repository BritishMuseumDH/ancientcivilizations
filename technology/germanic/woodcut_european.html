<p class="titleText">A European Woodcut</p>

<p class="mainText">This woodcut of Christ before King Herod is one of the earliest prints in the museum's collection. Unlike the Chinese woodcut this example does not contain any text, but block printing was used by artists as well as by book publishers. It dates from around AD 1400 and is from Germany, where the printing press was invented some fifty years later. It was created using a wood block that has been inked, and then paper has been laid onto it and rubbed from behind. This method of printing came from China (see the example of a Chinese woodcut).</p>
