tex=The need to reproduce important information many times over is nothing new. In the Middle East, people were using seals to stamp impressions of names or pictures on to various surfaces since ancient times. In India, Buddhists used ink rubbings to reproduce texts and pictures carved into stone in temples. <br><br>These techniques were imported to China and gained great influence.  However, these methods alone could not satisfy demand.  In around the 6th century AD woodblock printing appears.  This technique relied on the text (in reverse) being carved into a wood block. The wood block was painted with ink and pressed against a piece of a paper. <br><br>Literacy increased in China as a result of the invention of printing. The classic Confucian texts could now be circulated amongst a much greater number of people. Buddhist sacred texts could be distributed in massive numbers.  The first known complete printed and dated book is a Buddhist text called the Diamond Sutra. However, serious and important works were not the only things to be printed.  Calendars and almanacs were very popular as well as practical guides such as revision tips for exams.
