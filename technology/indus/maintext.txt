&tex=The Indus Valley Civilization is known for its many achievements as one of the first major civilizations in the ancient world. Among these early achievements was the ability to work stone precisely and finely enough to make small beads of different shapes and sizes. 
The long conical shaped beads and the round beads made of carnelian are two of the most common and unique types of beads made in the Indus Valley cities over four thousand years ago. These beads were sometimes decorated with designs in white and were traded all over the ancient world. 
Modern scientists have only learned about the methods used by these ancient people by experimenting with different production techniques themselves. Although we have no actual accounts of what the lives of the people who made these beads was like,  however, using archaeological evidence it is possible to begn to imagine some of the things they may have done as part of their daily lives.
