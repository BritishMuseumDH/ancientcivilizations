&tex=The word samurai conjures images of legendary fighting heroes, able to slice off the head of a man with a single blow of a gleaming sword. Perhaps most surprising of all is the fact that these famed Japanese warriors from the late 8th century, did live up to their celebrated reputation. 
Samurai literally means, 'one who serves.' Samurai warriors trained for years in the disciplines of swordsmanship, archery and endurance testing. Their devotion to their way of life was almost religious in nature and samurais were even prepared to die for their shogun. 
Central to the samurai's way of life, was their sword - a piece of technology far superior to those made before or since. Samurais were the only people within the strict class structure who were allowed to carry two swords. As their most lethal and treasured possession, the samurai's sword was handed down from father to son.
