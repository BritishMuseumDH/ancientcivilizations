&instructions=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">Explore this Moche pot to learn about a weaver's workshop.</font>
&text_1=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">This is a rare Moche pot which shows the only known scene of Moche weavers. </font>
&text_2=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">This is a type of <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/l/loom.html','glos')"><u>loom</u></a></font> which was tied at one end to a pole and the other around the weaver’s waist. Looms like this were used to make textiles, often with complex patterns.</font>
&text_3=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">This is a group of bobbins used in weaving. Different coloured cotton threads and possibly brightly coloured dyed wool would have been wound around bobbins like this. </font>
&text_4=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">This is a sample of cloth which either represents a pattern which the weaver followed, or part of a finished garment. </font>
&text_5=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">Archaeologists have found workshops which were constructed in this manner with <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/a/adobe.html','glos')"><u>adobe</u></a></font> walls and wood posts.Thus, archaeological evidence confirms that this drawing is quite accurate. </font>
&text_6=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">This roof seems to be made of pieces of wood or reeds lashed together. </font>
&text_7=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">This is an example of a Moche pot. The Moche are known for their fine pottery which was produced for <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/ceremonial .html','glos')"><u>ceremonial </u></a></font>as well as everyday purposes.  </font>
&text_8=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">This woman is a weaver in the workshop. Weavers would have worked together in workshops such as this to produce cloth for the <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/elite.html','glos')"><u>elite</u></a></font> and for ceremonial purposes.</font>
&text_9=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">The three seated men in this scene are all wearing fine clothing. This suggests that they are members of the <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/e/elite.html','glos')"><u>elite</u></a></font>. A fourth man is offering a bowl to one of the seated men. This bowl may have contained a drink called chicha.</font>
&text_10=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">The weavers in this workshop are all women. However, we know that in later ancient Peruvian cultures, both women and men were weavers as they are today in different communities.</font>
&text_11=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">Some archaeologists think that workshops making luxury goods would have been closely supervised. It is therefore possible that one or more of these men are supervising the weavers’ work.</font>
&text_12=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">These bobbins were used to weave the threads in and out of the <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/l/loom_warps.html','glos')"><u>loom warps</u></a></font> to make different patterns.</font>
