&tex=The city of Tiwanaku was built on a mountain plain next to Lake Titicaca.  The huge lake lies between the high mountains and plains to the west and the eastern mountain slopes leading to the tropical forests.  Tiwanaku was important as the centre of trade between all these areas and an important religious site at the crossroads of these different environments.  
The people of Tiwanaku used a very intensive system of farming.  They farmed on raised fields which prevented frost damage, using water brought from the mountains in canals.  This allowed people to grow enough crops to support a large population.  
In the centre of Tiwanaku, the people built palaces for the rulers and religious buildings.  A large pyramid represented the nearby sacred mountains, the mountain streams and the people’s success in controlling that water for their own use.   The religious centre also had stone images of Tiwanaku’s gods connected to the sun, wind and rain which were important in agriculture and llama herding.  This Tiwanaku religion spread to many parts of the Tiwanaku empire and other places in the central Andes.
