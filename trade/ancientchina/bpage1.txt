tex=The Silk Road was the trade route, or in actual fact routes, that linked China with the Mediterranean. It is called the Silk Road, due to the amount of silk that was exported from China to the West along the route. 
Its beginnings date from 139 B.C. when Emperor Wu sent Zhang Qian to central Asia to buy horses. While travelling, Zhang Qian was captured. When he eventually returned to China he brought valuable information about the countries to the west. By the end of the century, merchants were travelling frequently along this route.
