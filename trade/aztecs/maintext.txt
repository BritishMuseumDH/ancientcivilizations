&tex=The Aztecs developed a huge empire across a large part of what is now Mexico, with Tenochtitlan as its capital city. This gave them access to a wide range of goods and crafts produced by different <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/s/subject.html','glos')"><u>subject</u></a></font> peoples throughout the empire. Some of these goods were brought to the capital as <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/t/tribute.html','glos')"><u>tribute</u></a></font>, but trade routes were also established between the capital and territories in and outside the tAztec empire. These were often over long distances and many of them were to obtain luxury items. The <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/m/merchant.html','glos')"><u>merchants</u></a></font> that carried out this trade were called the pochteca.
Many goods were on sale in the market at Tlatelolco, which had become a part of Tenochtitlan in 1473. The market was so large that when the Spanish first saw it they were amazed. They wrote that 20,000 people visited the market daily and 40,000-50,000 every fifth day. Supplies were brought to the market by canoe via the canals. In the market there was a huge variety of things to be bought, from pottery dishes to slaves and cotton bales to the feathers of eagles. These were also places where people could exchange gossip and news.
