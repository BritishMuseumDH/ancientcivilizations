<p class="mainText">Whilst found in Egypt it is thought that this pendant is of Minoan manufacture. It is similar to a gold pendant also found in Egypt at Avaris and a pendant from the Aigina Treasure, which came from an island with a Minoan colony. All three pendants are made in a similar way and are alike in style, so it is thought that all were made by the artisans of one particular area. The silver pendant, therefore, does seem to show some sort of connection between Crete and Egypt and so could have been traded from Crete.</p>
