&text_2=The object shown here is a small drinking cup with red and white stripes. This type of pottery, called <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/k/kamares.html','glos')"><u>Kamares Ware</u></a></font>, was produced in Crete and exported to Egypt. It gets its name from the Kamares Cave where much of this pottery has been found. It has a recognisable style, using red, orange, yellow and white paint on a dark background, which means we can quickly identify Kamares Ware when found outside Crete.
&text_3=Archaeologists have found Minoan <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/k/kamares.html','glos')"><font color="#660000"><u>Kamares</u></font></a> Ware at Lahun in Egypt. In fact the first examples of Kamares Ware found during an excavation were from this Egyptian site. The pottery <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/s/sherd.html','glos')"><font color="#660000"><u>sherds</u></font></a> you see here are from a Minoan Kamares vase that was <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/i/imported.html','glos')"><u>imported</u></a></font> into Egypt. 
&text_4=This vase with a crinkled rim is an Egyptian copy of the Minoan Kamares pottery, from Lahun in Egypt. This suggests that the <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/k/kamares.html','glos')"><u>Kamares Ware</u></a></font> was very desirable in Egypt, but the copies made from Egyptian clay are not of the same standard as the Minoan originals.
&text_5=This gold falcon was found in Crete but it is thought that it could be an Egyptian object. The falcon was an important symbol in Egypt, but the head and holes for attaching the falcon to a chain are not thought to be of Egyptian workmanship. Some experts think that it could have been altered or actually made in Minoan Crete. Therefore this object might have been traded from Egypt but if not, it shows contact between the two countries which led to new influences on jewellery design. 
&text_6=Whilst found in Egypt it is thought that this pendant is of Minoan <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/m/manufacture2.html','manu')"><u>manufacture</u></a></font>. It is similar to a gold pendant also found in Egypt at Avaris and a pendant from the Aigina Treasure, which came from an island with a Minoan colony. All three pendants are made in a similar way and are alike in style, so it is thought that all were made by the <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/a/artisan.html','arti')"><u>artisans</u></a></font> of one particular area. The silver pendant, therefore, does seem to show some sort of connection between Crete and Egypt and so could have been traded from Crete.
