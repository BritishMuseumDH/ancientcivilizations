&tex=The Silk Road, in fact, refers to several routes, both land and sea, linking China with the West.  The main route ran from Chang'an (Xi'an) in China to the eastern Mediterranean. The bulk of the trade was in silk, which was exported from China. However it was not the only product carried along these routes.
