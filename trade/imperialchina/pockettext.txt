They could smell underground water. If a sandstorm was approaching they would huddle together and bury their mouths in the sand.  This alerted their riders to the imminent danger.<br><br><b>Camel's feet</b><br>Camels have very large feet. This means that their weight is distributed over a large area. This makes it much easier for them to walk in the desert.  Their feet would not sink down in the sand as much as other animals.<br><br><b>Provisions</b><br>Most merchants would not have travelled the whole length of the Silk Road.  Goods would be carried by a number of traders and merchants on the journey from East to West. Traders embarking on the Silk Road had to make sure they had enough provisions with them. The Silk Road went north and south around the Taklamakan Desert.  Travellers would stock up on provisions in oasis towns along the way. </font>

It keeps you cool when the weather is warm and warm when the weather is cold.  Silk imports led to such a drain of gold in Rome that it harmed the economy. The Roman writer Pliny complained that women's desire for the material was ruining the Roman Empire.  During the Tang dynasty, thirty percent of the trade on the Silk Road was comprised of silk.</font>

&exportlacquer=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">Lacquer is a natural varnish made from the sap of the lacquer tree. It is a clear liquid that has a brownish tinge. Pigment can be added to the sap. From the Song dynasty (A.D. 960 -1279) onwards many layers of lacquer were applied to objects. Each layer had to dry completely before another could be added. This meant that making lacquerware was an extremely time-consuming and skilled job. Lacquerware was extremely expensive.</font>

They were very useful in warfare - they were vital in fighting off the nomads who roamed around China’s northern border. They were also a sign of great wealth.  Native horses tended to be small and stocky animals.  The Chinese used the Silk Road to import the fine thoroughbreds from the steppes of Central Asia.  Polo was another import from Central Asia that gained popularity in China.</font>

The Chinese began to establish their own gold and silver working industry, influenced by the techniques of Western Asian silversmiths.</font>  &silkcaption=Selling silk in modern Kashgar
