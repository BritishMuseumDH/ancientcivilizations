text_1=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">By AD 1300, Venice was the centre of one of the main trade networks in Europe, which allowed it to control the trade routes with Asia. From here came the much desired <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/commodity.html','glos')"><u>commodity</u></a></font> of spice. As spice came across land from India it went through a number of countries which <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/t/taxed.html','taxe')"><u>taxed</u></a></font> the goods that were being transported by <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/m/merchant.html','merc')"><u>merchants</u></a></font>. This meant that when the spices eventually got to Venice, where further <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/d/duties.html','duti')"><u>duties</u></a></font> were paid, the price was very high to cover all the costs of bringing the spices so far. Some countries wanted to find other ways of bringing the spice from India. The Portuguese were successful in establishing a sea route around Africa to the western coast of India. They were then able to bring spices back by ship to Lisbon and as the spices had not been taxed along the route they were cheaper to buy than in Venice. This meant that Venice no longer had control of the trade in spices across the Mediterranean.</font>

&text_land1=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">The spice trade from India was centred on Calicut. Spices from a number of areas in India and islands to the east were brought to Calicut from where they were eventually transported to Europe. The spices that were in particular demand in Europe were ginger, pepper, cloves and nutmeg.</font>
&text_land2=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">From Calicut the spices were brought across land, passing through Syria and the lands of the <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/o/ottoman_emp.html','otta')"><u>Ottoman Empire</u></a></font>. These countries taxed the goods as they passed through.</font>
&text_land3=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">The spices were brought to cities around the eastern Mediterranean. Two of the main cities at the end of the land route from India were Alexandria on the north coast of Egypt and Istanbul (previously Constantinople and now in modern Turkey). It was with these two cities that the Venetian merchants traded, loading the spices into ships to bring them to Venice across the Mediterranean.</font>
&text_land4=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">Once the spices reached Venice they were sold on at high prices to merchants from around Europe, where spices were becoming increasingly in demand. The price in Venice was described by a Venetian merchant as being sixty or one hundred times the price that was paid for the spice in India.</font>
&text_sea1=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">The Portuguese sea route also started in Calicut, where the boats were loaded with the spices, particularly pepper.</font>
&text_sea2=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">The boats crossed the Indian Ocean where the Portuguese had stationed gunships so that only their ships were able to travel safely along this route.</font>
&text_sea3=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">The boats travelled down the east coast of Africa and around the Cape of Good Hope.</font>
&text_sea4=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">The ships now headed up the west coast of Africa and then on to Portugal and the capital city, Lisbon. </font>
&text_sea5=<font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="14">The ships arrived in Lisbon where merchants from around Europe bought pepper and other spices for cheaper prices than they were sold for in Venice.</font>
