<p class="mainText">This gold falcon was found in Crete but it is thought that it could be an Egyptian object. The falcon was an important symbol in Egypt, which suggests that it could have been made there, but the head and holes for attaching the falcon to a chain are not though to be of Egyptian workmanship. Some experts think that it could have been altered or actually made in Minoan Crete. Therefore this object might have been traded from Egypt but if not, it shows contact between the two countries which led to new influences on jewellery design.</p>
