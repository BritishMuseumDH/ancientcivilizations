tex=The original runic alphabet, called the Futhark after the first six letters, usually had 24 letters and could be used to write many languages.  Inscriptions have been found in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, England, Germany, Poland, Russia and Hungary.  Many of the inscriptions are so short that scholars do not agree about what they mean.  The Anglo-Saxon version was slightly different, so is known as the futharc. It had thirty-one letters.
