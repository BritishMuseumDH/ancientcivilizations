tex=The runic script was not designed for writing out long texts.  The script was originally used simply to inscribe a word or words onto sticks of wood.  The straight lines used to form each letter were created deliberately as it is so hard to inscribe a curve in a material such as wood.  Wood was the perfect material to use in northern Europe.  Not only is it easy to find, but it is easy to carve, carry and it can be reused by carving out the original inscription.  Later texts could be quite extensive, even reaching the length of a letter.
