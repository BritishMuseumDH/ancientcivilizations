&tex=The runic script is a mystery.  No-one knows where or when it was invented.  The earliest runes discovered come from the second century AD, but they must have been in use long before this.  Runes were used by many people to record information on metal, bone, stone or wood.  
The runic alphabet, called the Futhark after the first six letters, usually had 24 letters and could be used to write many languages.  Inscriptions have been found in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, England, Germany, Poland, Russia and Hungary.  Many of the inscriptions are so short that scholars do not agree about what they mean.   
About 5000 runic inscriptions survive.  Most of the inscriptions come from Sweden, Norway and Denmark, but about 70 have been found in England.  One of the most important objects from Anglo-Saxon England is the Franks Casket.  It is a whalebone box inscribed with runes in two languages, old English and Latin.
