&tex=The Indus script is one of the most fascinating and mysterious aspects of this ancient civilization as it has not yet been <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/d/deciphered.html','glos')">deciphered</a></u></font>. Although we have many examples of the Indus script, without a true understanding of how the script works and what the inscriptions say, it is impossible to understand the importance of writing in ancient India. 
All writing systems have rules governing their use. By learning these rules, it is possible to understand more about how a system developed and how it was used. When a script has not yet been deciphered, scholars try to work out what the rules of the script might have been. If they are able to find patterns in the signs or the way they are used, it is sometimes possible to relate the script to one that is already known. Although the Indus script has not yet been deciphered, it is possible to learn about the signs themselves which may be the first step to understanding the Indus script.
