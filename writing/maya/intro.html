        <p>The lintels you are about to explore were placed above three doorways 
          which led into a temple structure at Yaxchilan, so that anyone entering 
          the building would have walked beneath them. We cannot be certain what 
          this particular temple looked like; therefore our model is based on 
          the standard layout of most of the main temples in Yaxchilan. These 
          lintels were commissioned by Lord Bird Jaguar, who used them to emphasize 
          that he was the rightful heir to the throne. They record him taking 
          a captive and also the birth of his son, both important acts before 
          he could become king. One lintel also shows Bird Jaguar's connection 
          with an important ancestor, giving him a legitimate right to be king.</p>
