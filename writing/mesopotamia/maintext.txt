&tex=The writing system used in Mesopotamia is called <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/c/cuneiform.html','glos')">cuneiform</a></u></font>. This system developed over several hundred years beginning with <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/p/pictogram.html','glos')">pictograms</a></u></font> which were first used to represent real things beginning around 3200 B.C. These pictograms were soon simplified and changed to better represent ideas as well as things. 
Writing systems always develop and change based on the needs of the people who use them. Sometimes the shape, orientation and meaning of individual signs also changes over time. By tracing the development of the cuneiform script, it is possible to learn about the needs of the people who used the script as well as how it changed over time.
