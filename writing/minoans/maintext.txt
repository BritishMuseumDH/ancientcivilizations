&tex=It was the age of discovery.  In the nineteenth century archaeologists had found new civilizations, buried treasure and lost cities.  Between 1900 and 1906 Arthur Evans, the curator of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, was to unearth all three on the island of Crete in the Mediterranean.  
A writing system had led Evans to his discovery.  His first clue came from sealstones which had pictures and symbols on them.   Arthur Evans was sure that an advanced civilization on Crete had created these sealstones and he started to dig at Knossos, in an area where sealstones and other objects had already been found.

The palace was full of important artefacts, including evidence for three writing systems, Cretan Hieroglyphs, Linear A and Linear B
