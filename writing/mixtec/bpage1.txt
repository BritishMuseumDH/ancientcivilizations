tex=Making a book to record information is a complex process.  It takes a lot of time and patience.  There were two main materials used to make books in Mesoamerica, deer-skin and bark-paper.  
Deer-skin
Deer-skin was a popular material to use for book production.  Almost all Mixtec books that have survived are made from deer-skin.  First, the skin was cut into strips of equal breadth.  Many strips would be glued or sewn together to make a long band which could be several metres long.  Then the prepared skin was folded like a concertina ready for the scribes to start their work.
Bark-paper 
Many different plants were used to make bark-paper.  The white, inner part of the bark was soaked away from the brown, outer part of the bark.  The white bark was then laid out, probably on a wooden board, and beaten to produce a smooth sheet.  This was then left to dry and finally cut into a <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/u/uniform.html','glos')">uniform</a></u></font> size and shape for the scribes.
Once the paper had been made the <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/s/scribe.html','glos')">scribes</a></u></font> would record the information needed.  The colours used by the scribes came from plants, flowers, soil, charcoal and insects.  When the scribes had finished their work the paper was treated to stop the pictograms fading over time.
