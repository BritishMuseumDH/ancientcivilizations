tex=Most modern alphabets have two types of letter, consonants and vowels.  The Phoenician alphabet only had consonants.  Some Phoenician letters had to be used in the same way as vowels to make it possible to read the words.  When the Greeks adopted the Phoenician  alphabet they needed to include vowels in order to write the words of their language.  By the fifth century BC the Greeks had added some letters to the original Phoenician alphabet and adapted others to suit the needs of their language.
