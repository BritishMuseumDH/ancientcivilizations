tex=The tablets are written in <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/l/latin.html','glos')">Latin</a></u></font>, but not the sort of Latin used by classical writers such as <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/c/cicero.html','glos')">Cicero</a></u></font>. It is the Latin that was used by ordinary people. The handwriting is varied: some is quite poor but other examples are well-executed. The majority of the tablets found at Vindolanda were written in ink on thin slices of wood, but a few were wax tablets, where the writing was <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/i/incised.html','glos')">incised</a></u></font> with a <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/s/stylus.html','glos')">stylus</a></u></font> into the wax. Although the wax has perished some of the writing which had pressed through into the wood has survived. The more complete examples generally fall into two groups: private letters and official documents. Many of them are to do with the Roman army, as they are either official army records of the fort or are the private papers of the soldiers. The letters include both formal and informal examples of writing. We know that wooden tablets like these were used in other parts of the empire for <font color="#FFCC66"><u><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/a/accounts.html','glos')">accounts</a></u></font> and letters as well.
