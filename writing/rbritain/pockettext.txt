&text_3=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">Read about Sulpicia Lepidina, as she receives the birthday invitation</font>
&text_4=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">Sulpicia Lepidina was really pleased to receive the birthday invitation from her friend.<br><br>She was looking forward to the thought of seeing her friend as she sometimes felt rather lonely at the fort, which was on the northern frontier of the <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/r/roman_province.html','glos')"><u>Roman province</u></a></font> of Britain and therefore in quite a remote location.<br><br>It would be nice to see Severa's young son again: it had been a while since she had last spent time with Severa's family. <br><br>She reread the invitation now: whilst most of it had been written by a scribe she noted that Severa had added some lines of her own. Her handwriting was not quite as elegant as the scribe's but Lepidina knew that Severa was very proud of her ability to write. <br><br>Lepidina laid the wooden tablet on the table beside her. She must speak to her husband before replying to her friend's invitation, but the thought of the party had already brightened her day. </font>

&text_10=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">A writing tablet with a letter from a businessman, Octavius to Candidus</font>
&text_11=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">Read about Candidus, as he receives the businessman's letter</font>
&text_12=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">Candidus rubbed his eyes and once more began to read the detailed letter he had received from Octavius.<br><br>He had clearly written it in a hurry as there were a number of misspellings and the handwriting was rather untidy. For this reason Candidus was struggling a little to make out the content of the letter. He knew that it was about Octavius' business arrangements with the Roman army, which he supplied with various goods.<br><br>Candidus scanned the first few lines and let out a quiet sigh. Octavius had requested money for a large amount of grain that he had paid a <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/d/deposit.html','glos')"><u>deposit</u></a></font> for. He would lose the deposit if Candidus didn't send at least five hundred denarii.<br><br>Candidus read on a little further.<br><br>Octavius also asked about the <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/h/hide.html','glos')"><u>hides</u></a></font>  at <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/cataractonium.html','glos')"><u>Cataractonium</u></a></font> which he was willing to collect; he had not collected them before now as the roads had been bad and he was worried about injuring the animals that would pull his cart.<br><br>Candidus decided he would write to Octavius straight away as there were a few matters that needed settling. As for the five hundred denarii, well, he would have to speak to the centurion about that!</font>

&text_21=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">Cerialis, commander of the fort of Vindolanda, glanced at the <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/m/memorandum.html','glos')"><u>memorandum</u></a></font> in front of him.<br><br>It had been left to him by the previous commander of the fort and provided information on the native Britons beyond the <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/f/frontier.html','glos')"><u>frontier</u></a></font>, who were still getting used to Roman rule in the area of Vindolanda.<br><br>Cerialis had not had many encounters with the native tribes occupying the land close to the frontier and was therefore quite interested in what his <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/p/predecessor.html','glos')"><u>predecessor</u></a></font> had to say.<br><br>It was clear from the letter that the Britons fought in quite a different way to the Romans. They didn't wear armour to protect themselves as the Romans did, but they did have <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/cavalry.html','glos')"><u>cavalry</u></a></font>. These were different from Roman cavalry however, as the men did not use swords. Neither did they throw javelins from horseback.<br><br>Cerialis thought about the information: the previous commander seemed to be quite <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/d/dismissive.html','glos')"><u>dismissive</u></a></font> of British fighting abilities, but Cerialis knew that these native people might be useful as recruits into the local units of the Roman army.<br><br>This way they changed from being potential troublemakers that must be crushed into defenders of the Roman province of Britain.</font>

&text_29=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">Read about the fort commander's children, as they practise their writing</font>
&text_30=<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="14">Cerialis, the commander of the fort of Vindolanda, had, like other senior officers, been able to bring his family with him to this posting. They lived in the residence of the commanding officer, called the praetorium.<br><br>His two children had come to the fort feeling great excitement, as Vindolanda was on the northern <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/f/frontier.html','glos')"><u>frontier</u></a></font> of the <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/r/roman_province.html','glos')"><u>Roman province</u></a></font> and provided protection against the native tribes to the north. <br><br>They had thought that they might see some of these fierce warriors about whom they had heard exciting stories from the soldiers based at Vindolanda. So far though there had not been any sightings to match the thrilling stories and the children's lives still contained activities of an ordinary nature.<br><br>They still had to practise their <font color="#FFCC66"><a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/l/latin.html','glos')"><u>Latin</u></a></font> and for this they used wooden tablets which they wrote on in ink using a reed pen. <br><br>When practising their writing they sometimes used the work of the Roman poet Virgil, whose poems they would copy onto the wooden tablets, or write down some lines that they had memorized. <br><br>The children were usually not too keen to study but their mother, Lepidina, would not listen to their protests. They must practise their Latin writing. After all, what would their literate slave think if the commander's children could not write as well as he did? </font>
