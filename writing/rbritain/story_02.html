	<p class="mainText">Candidus rubbed his eyes and once more began to read the detailed letter he had received from Octavius</p>

	<p class="mainText">He had clearly written it in a hurry as there were a number of misspellings and the handwriting was rather untidy. For this reason Candidus was struggling to make out the content of the letter</p>

	<p class="mainText">He knew that it was about Octavius' business arrangements with the Roman army, which he supplied with various goods.</p>

	<p class="mainText">Candidus scanned the first few lines and let out a quiet sigh. Octavius had requested money for a large amount of grain that he had paid a deposit for. He would lose the deposit if Candidus didn't send at least five hundred denarii.</p>

	<p class="mainText">Candidus read on a little further. Octavius also asked about the hides at Cataractonium which he was willing to collect; he had not collected them before now as the roads had been bad and he was worried about injuring the animals that would pull his cart.</p>

	<p class="mainText">Candidus decided he would write to Octavius straight away as there were a few matters that needed settling. As for the five hundred denarii, well, he would have to speak to the centurion about that!</p>
